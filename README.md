### Do you work for your tools? 08.11

Finally a nice way to describe the purpose of all my over-the-top organization.  The epitome of organization is that you don't work for your tools - your tools work for you.  Consider the things you own.  A screwdriver.  A broom.  A hack saw. Even a drinking glass.  Each of these, we can call a tool because it's a means to get something done.  To answer the question of who works for who, it is simple:  Do you spend more time handling the item or using the item?

The journey of the drinking glass.  Let's say I want a coffee and a half glass of orange juice for the morning.   The drinking glass does it's job while it's putting orange juice in my mouth.  The rest of the journey is: I set it in the sink.  I wash it at some point.  I dry it and set it on a drying rack.  It may air dry, or I need the space and I dry it manually.  I put it on the shelf.  I retrieve it from the shelf.  The tasks are stacking up quickly.  If the shelf is cluttered, I adjust other glasses to fit it in the shelf.  If there was a dishwasher involved, it went into the dishwasher and came back out.  If it's one of those terrible cups that has a bottom rim, I shake the water off and wipe it dry with a towel, then it goes to the shelf.  If the shelf has a door, I open the door.  If the door hinge isn't auto-closing, I close it.

When you add up all the handling tasks, it easily surpasses the time I spent with my lips to the cup.  So, we have an epic failure in my mind.  I paid money for a thing, and then I worked for the thing.  Lose-lose.  And if it's a thing I use daily, it's an eternal cycle of spending more time giving than receiving what I wanted.  The more you own, the more you work for your things.  In modern life you can easily consume all of your time workign for things after you've already bought them.  

There are a couple of ways out.  The first way, is to buy more stuff to make it easier.  A better dishwasher that dries things.  A deeper sink that holds more stuff.  Fancier cabinet doors that swing shut.  A classy rinse aid in your dishwasher so you've got no spots.  Buy Buy Buy.  If you pay attention, you'll find that your purchases end up doing the same as the item that caused you labor.  The rinse aid didn't fit under the sink, so you journey to the garage to store it, and journey back to use it.  You journey to the store to buy more, or you journey online to order it, and when it comes in the mail you journey to find a tool to unbox it.  This is the way of the modern economy.  Buy more stuff.  Become momentarily happy.  Wish daily that you had better stuff, and spend enough time online to get advertisements for the solutions - the next stuff. 

The second way out:  Study yourself.  Notice where you spend your time.  Adjust your things, the layout, your habits, until your stuff starts working for you.  Purge stuff that serves you less than it costs you.  Simplify.  Go back to basics.  The more I do this, the more I find my solutions at dollar tree.  The complexity of life is reversing.  More time for leisure.  More time for family and doing the things I love.

And imagine, with a little bit of skill and a few tools, you can begin to adjust your own stuff to make it suit you.  The first thing I did when I moved into my kitchen was remove the doors from the cabinet I access most. It cost me 2 minutes with a screwdriver and it saved me hours by now.  Not exaggerating.  The removal of the door means airflow.  Airflow means I can put away the dishes wet, and they dry in place.  I don't even use the drying rack anymore.  Less steps for everything.

### severe weather 08.09
wow the heat in bryan is intense.  I had to make repairs to the AC and found a few leaks.  Earlier this week it was running nonstop and multiple rooms couldn't reach below 77F.  Now I've installed some additional insulation and repaired the insulation on the ducts in the attic.  Looks like the AC can keep up much better.
