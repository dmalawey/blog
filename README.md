## 08.23 Meal Prep^4

When I'm depressed I don't even have drive to cook for myself.  This year, my best friend (happy David) gave me an awesome gift to help out during those times.  He meal prepped for me, and more. It's really starting to change things.  If you have a best friend as good as mine, ask if they'll help you do things like this.

## 08.21 Welcome to America.

I've spoken these words many times, and occasionally I'm told by Americans that it's offensive. I respect that opinion but I disagree.  Their concern is that it sounds that we have claimed the whole continent in referring to my country. This would be concerning for me too, but I am certainly not claiming the whole continent for my country and I have never met someone who does this, so far.

This phrase is English for "Welcome to the United States of America" in American-English, since Americans often abbreviate their country name when speaking.  The fact that we abbreviate is common knowledge among English native speakers in the USA, Canada, and Europe.  For these people, it's okay to use the phrase because they know it is spoken with kindness - except for a select few who have distain and poor assumptions about Americans and you may enjoy abbreviating just to troll them 🙂.

**Here are some phrases I use to welcome people with consideration for their background:**
* If I wish to welcome a spanish-speaker to the USA, I say "bienvenido a America."
* If I wish to welcome a Mexican spanish-speaker to the USA, I say "bienvenido a Los Estados Unidos." I would not say "bienvenido a America" because they already came from the American continent and that might infer a claim to the continent. If you said this phrase to a Mexican or Latino spanish speaker I agree it may be offensive and I personally don't use that phrase to greet a Latino.
* If I wish to welcome a close friend is Mexican and returning to the USA, I tell them "welcome to America" with a grin and we both understand it is a joke.
* If I wish to welcome a close friend who is Brazilian I use "bem vindo a America" to the same effect.
* If I wish to welcome an acquaintence who is Brazilian I use "welcome to America" with a smile and if she is a woman, with a kiss on the cheek per Brazilian culture (and most latino cultures).  I use body language to show that it is a genuine welcoming and I use the english phrase in my American accent so that they can become familiar with the phrase, and establish if they hear that phrase during the rest of their travel, it has a warm meaning. 
* If I wish to welcome a mexican friend in a professional setting of mostly spanish speakers I use "bienvenido a los Estados Unidos."
* If I wish to welcome a mexican acquaintence in a professional setting of mostly English speakers, I use "welcome to the United States."
* If I wish to welcome an acquaintence from Europe and I do not know what language they speak, I use "welcome to America" so they become familiar with my accent.
* If you wish to welcome an English speaker from Canada to the United States, you can say "welcome to the USA" or "welcome to America." It isn't offensive because in Canada it's common knowledge that US people abbreviate United States of America with just America.
* If I am welcoming a Canadian, I use "welcome to Texas" because they probably already feel welcome in the United States. 
* If I am in latin america and I greet a person who arrived from overseas, I use "welcome to america" or "bienvenido a america" to let them know I am aware America is a continent and that Americans like myself do not claim the word America for the United States.

I have never met an American who claims the whole continent by calling themselves Americans.  If you meet someone who feels that way, I recommend you learn where that feeling comes from and maybe we can help make adjustments.


## 08.21 I woke up and immediately faced an engineering problem.

It's a normal morning. I wake up, and the first thing I have to do is solve an engineering problem:  The problem is aiming a nozzle into a bowl. The nozzle is 44 inches (1.1m) off the ground, pointed 60 degrees above horizontal, and the bowl is 17 inches (0.4m) above the floor; the target is 11 inches (0.3m) in diameter with a horizontal opening. This problem must be solved at 5:30am, in the dark. There's a window nearby, with a base at 48 inches (1.2m) from the floor. From an engineering standpoint, it's easier to purge the nozzle out the window than to purge it into the bowl. I think any engineer would agree.  But for social reasons, it is unacceptable to purge the liquid outside of the home. Actually considering what is socially acceptable, the liquid may only be purged into the original bowl.

I'm a proponent of gender equality but I think mostly males face this problem and I don't know why it has not been solved.  Now I'm reminded of several other problems we have in society that have not been solved very well.

The measurements of the human body for the purpose of design is called anthropometrics. [This PDF](https://lobfile.com/file/LEdg.pdf) features some anthropometric data and the percentiles of the US population. I'll save it here for reference in future discussions.

## 08.14 There are only 2 reasons to jump

Today my close friend messaged me, says she's a little bit sad.  I'm honored to be a safe person to whom she reached out and I thought about her situation.  Just made a move into a new apartment, getting settled, nothing else really changed. And I think I've had the exact same experience before.  If you have ever played Frogger, then you might follow this analogy:

In the game of frogger, there is only one action you can do ► jump.  And there are only two reasons to jump.  The first reason is to take a step towards your goal, and the other reason is to avoid harm.  Just like frogger, life sends problems down our path such as logs and cars and things we don't usually consider problems, just minor events (as adults). If it's time for you to renew your license for example, you must take an action. We don't call it a problem, but it's something that forces you to act, or otherwise face problems.  These get much bigger all the way to having a newborn child and having to equip your home with new furniture for the baby.  

Well, why might you feel sad after you took a jump?  You knew it was required.  You didn't encounter any harm.  But now you are, if you introspect, in a whole new situation. So what is the impact on our psychology?  If all else is equal, you should feel the same as you felt before the jump, but there's an added burden. It's time to reassess the dangers or opportunities. Your mind will subtly be reviewing risks and new tasks required of you, basically a whole 360 scan of what's necessary ► and you have to do it while you keep your remaining life items steady.  It can be taxing.

I have moved apartments many times, and sometimes it is a jump for advancement and sometimes it is a jump by requirement.  The **actions are exactly the same but the psychology is far different.**  Just thinking about this gives me a little bit of consolation and readiness to "go easy on myself" if I just landed a required jump and I feel off.  It's time I note that reassesssing every minor change is actually a big task for a human and if we give credit to ourselves for this effort, we might be able to pivot sadness into a little bit of proudness and self reassurance.  Or, by some strong trickery of the mind, we could convince ourselves that it was a jump for advancement, and that is valid too.  It's your own life.

## 08.14 I almost burned down the house.

I dont always start a fire, but when i do, its because i found a new way to do it.  This time, the lawn sprinkler was too close to the electrical box.

Nobody was hurt, the house is ok, and i consider this a learning experience.  The painful part was losing HVAC for 24 hours and working a 14 hour sunday shift to repair the circuits in 110F texas heat, no clouds, no shade.

My home is from 1976 so the electric equipment is older than me. 47 years.  The outdoor panel was supposed to be waterproof and it was fully closed and locked. Further investigation is needed.

Here are some [photos of the damage](https://imgur.com/a/ux5YFTS)

## 08.12 Every morning, ideas

I'm waking up every morning overflowing with ideas, this month.  About philosophy, engineering, culture, language, business... I can't possibly write them down.  Here is a random one: laser ablation on acrylic round stock.  Fly fishermen and fly makers, jewelry makers, etc: they could have extremely detailed and transparent or glossy, accurate repeatable copies (or unique copies given our digital assets could be parameterized) of insects such as dragonflies and mayflies or whatever type of flies they like to make. The round stock can rotate and the laser scans, and they could actually build many copies in a matter of a minute if it works as fast as we can cut 1/4 inch acrylic sheets.  Extreme accuracy and detail, better than what we get with 3d printers currently.  And the true transparent color of acrylics is an asset for coloring as we wish.

## 08.11 Do you work for your tools?

Finally a nice way to describe the purpose of all my over-the-top organization.  The epitome of organization is that you don't work for your tools - your tools work for you.  Consider the things you own.  A screwdriver.  A broom.  A hack saw. Even a drinking glass.  Each of these, we can call a tool because it's a means to get something done.  To answer the question of who works for who, it is simple:  Do you spend more time handling the item or using the item?

The journey of the drinking glass.  Let's say I want a coffee and a half glass of orange juice for the morning.   The drinking glass does it's job while it's putting orange juice in my mouth.  The rest of the journey is: I set it in the sink.  I wash it at some point.  I dry it and set it on a drying rack.  It may air dry, or I need the space and I dry it manually.  I put it on the shelf.  I retrieve it from the shelf.  The tasks are stacking up quickly.  If the shelf is cluttered, I adjust other glasses to fit it in the shelf.  If there was a dishwasher involved, it went into the dishwasher and came back out.  If it's one of those terrible cups that has a bottom rim, I shake the water off and wipe it dry with a towel, then it goes to the shelf.  If the shelf has a door, I open the door.  If the door hinge isn't auto-closing, I close it.

When you add up all the handling tasks, it easily surpasses the time I spent with my lips to the cup.  So, we have an epic failure in my mind.  I paid money for a thing, and then I worked for the thing.  Lose-lose.  And if it's a thing I use daily, it's an eternal cycle of spending more time giving than receiving what I wanted.  The more you own, the more you work for your things.  In modern life you can easily consume all of your time workign for things after you've already bought them.  

There are a couple of ways out.  The first way, is to buy more stuff to make it easier.  A better dishwasher that dries things.  A deeper sink that holds more stuff.  Fancier cabinet doors that swing shut.  A classy rinse aid in your dishwasher so you've got no spots.  Buy Buy Buy.  If you pay attention, you'll find that your purchases end up doing the same as the item that caused you labor.  The rinse aid didn't fit under the sink, so you journey to the garage to store it, and journey back to use it.  You journey to the store to buy more, or you journey online to order it, and when it comes in the mail you journey to find a tool to unbox it.  This is the way of the modern economy.  Buy more stuff.  Become momentarily happy.  Wish daily that you had better stuff, and spend enough time online to get advertisements for the solutions - the next stuff. 

The second way out:  Study yourself.  Notice where you spend your time.  Adjust your things, the layout, your habits, until your stuff starts working for you.  Purge stuff that serves you less than it costs you.  Simplify.  Go back to basics.  The more I do this, the more I find my solutions at dollar tree.  The complexity of life is reversing.  More time for leisure.  More time for family and doing the things I love.

And imagine, with a little bit of skill and a few tools, you can begin to adjust your own stuff to make it suit you.  The first thing I did when I moved into my kitchen was remove the doors from the cabinet I access most. It cost me 2 minutes with a screwdriver and it saved me hours by now.  Not exaggerating.  The removal of the door means airflow.  Airflow means I can put away the dishes wet, and they dry in place.  I don't even use the drying rack anymore.  Less steps for everything.

## severe weather 08.09
wow the heat in bryan is intense.  I had to make repairs to the AC and found a few leaks.  Earlier this week it was running nonstop and multiple rooms couldn't reach below 77F.  Now I've installed some additional insulation and repaired the insulation on the ducts in the attic.  Looks like the AC can keep up much better.
