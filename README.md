## 11.02 Allegory of the River Cell

If I die tomorrow and I can only share one thing with the world, it may be this allegory.  I do not have any logical reason why, but it feels important right now.  The following text is a first draft and it does need some further writing to become complete.

**The layout** 

Imagine that your life takes place from birth to death inside of a special kind of cell.  It's a magic jail cell with some good and bad aspects.  The bad news is that you're all alone. The good news is that you can have anything that you want. 

The cell is a large room with a small river running through it, let's say the size of a basketball court.  It's a rectangle you cannot escape from, but you can wish for anything that you want.  If you wish for a steak dinner, you can have it instantly, and it flows in via the river, such that you could have yourself a whole dining place with a table, chairs, and your dinner.  It arrives when you're ready to use it, and there you have it in your cell for as long as you wish to use it.

**The experience, part A**

Any item that you finish using, will vanish from the cell.  For this reason, the limits of the space inside the cell are not very relevant. If you wish for any item, it will flow into the river and you may have it immediately. If you stop using it, it will vanish.  If you materially change it, it will flow out of the cell through the river exit.

For example, if you are a child and you want a soccer ball, it arrives and you may play.  At the very last time that you touch the ball, it will vanish. Only God knows when the last time is, just as in real life you cannot recall the last time that you played with your favorite ball.  The vanishing element has no real impact on your possessions overall, since you have full control of how long you wish to have things.  In that regard, you have no worries about your items vanishing. 

**The experience, Part B**


There are some items that do not vanish upon your last use.  These are items we will call art. If you materially change something, it will exit the cell but not by vanishing.  It will be deposited into the river and flow out of the cell, and into the world.  For example, if you whittle a block of wood into a turtle figurine, the figurine will flow out of the cell and the scraps of wood will vanish.  

Given the physics of the cell, one could stand outside your cell at the South and discover somewhat of a story of your life. By logic, anything that flows out of the cell was materially handled by you, and says something about you. Everything you've not impacted will vanish, because it isn't part of your story.  Your story, for the sake of terminology, is the full collection of items which have flown from your cell with it's chronology and every detail. Just as in real life, the items not materially changed by you have no mark of your existence.  (In real life, one could make the philosophical argument that perhaps all things exiting your life do in fact vanish, as there is no proof to you that it still exists). If another person wishes to prove your past belonging still exists, they would need to wish it into their respective cell, and it will appear in the same way that they imagined it. 

For an example of art, if you write a poem on a piece of paper, the paper will flow out of the cell and enter the world.  The unused paper vanishes, along with the pen or pencil you used. It remains in existence and it is linked to your individual story.

**Art**

In this allegory, every item conciously impacted by you, and materially impacted, is the only thing that exists after your life is over.  Art requires no skill, only attention and effort.  Skill is permitted but not required.

A very simple example of art may be a rubics cube.  If you wish one day for a rubics cube and you play with it, fiddling without intention, then it does not earn a place in your story and it vanishes.  If you solve the cube, even halfway, or even to a small degree it has been modified with intention, it will flow into your story when you're finished.  We call this art because there is no success or failure in your actions.  Perhaps your intention with the cube was to generate one face with a checkerboard pattern, of yellow and blue.  If you succeed or even partially succeed, the art populates your story.

![image-rubiks](https://github.com/dmalawey/blog/assets/42623372/c07b6b22-2b12-411b-a9db-7d6b3ce16bdc ':class=image-25')

You may become skillfull and create bigger things if you wish. Noah's ark became part of his story, not during the planning, not during the collection of materials, but when the first board was cut into the desired shape to build the hull.

**Restrictions**

You may wish for anything, but under one condition you will not receive it.  If the item does not exist, you cannot have it.  Existentials are items which either can be found in nature or have been made by another person, at any time in history.  Existentials are comprised of every item that has every been made, not only those which you can find in the modern present time. So, in your cell you may wish for a 5-dollar currency note and it appears, but if you wish for a 6-dollar currency note it probably does not exist; therefore you cannot have it. However, you can make it, and it's easy. If you really wanted a six-dollar currency note for some reason, you may wish for all of the tools to make it, and have the tools instantly. You may wish for the entire printing press, and the computer with its collection of templates for US Dollar currency.  We can admit that you probably would not wish for any currency, since you can have everything you want for free - then suddenly all of the currency in the world has no purpose - but this is not entirely true. You may wish for instructions to operate the machines, and you may wish for a quick-start guide instead of the 400 page manual that comes along with the printing press ink reservoir.  As long as the quick start guide is an existential, you may have it immediately.  Otherwise, you may only have the full manual and it may take much more time for you to make your 6-dollar note.

**Layers of art**

Written into the currency, there are details which are art.  The face of hamilton on my 10 dollar bill is art that was made by an illustrator.  This face, in whichever medium it was formed (perhaps pencil on paper, or perhaps later as a digital design on a thumb drive), exists as art, somewhere, totally separate from the note itself, and comes from the story of the individual who illustrated it.  Further along in history, the placement of president Hamilton on the near-center of a note, adorned with geometric patterns, exists yet again but without the serial number JB7760653A, as found on my 10-dollar bill today.  Further still, the individual note with my specific serial number, became existential when a person made it.   Notice that these three items (the portrait, the note design, and the final serialized note) are three separate existentials linked to three different individuals in history.

**Broader view**

Now let us review existentials with a step back in perspective. They are everything that exists and everything that ever has existed materially.  They can be broken down into art and nature.  Art is an item that is coupled to an individual's intention and nature is everything that exists without human intention.  We hereby have a new definition for art and nature for this allegory.

With these new definitions, we can explore all existentials as art, nature, and in a sense, combinations.  There are no blends of art and nature in the existential itself, but there are blends in the stories only.  A raspberry seed may be planted by an individual and grow into a bush.  The bush itself is nature and it bears more nature, in the fruit, and so on.  Nature requires no intention; it just happens.  What happens to the intention that was set in the action of planting the seed?  The answer is easier to offer with an adjusted situation.

If you choose to plant three raspberries, your intention was delivered in only the placement.  They may be spaced 1 meter apart from one another, and this spacing is where your intention materially impacted the other existentials.  Collectively, your row of three berry plants with 1-meter spacing, is a work of art.  Your story includes this art, a small garden consisting of 3 plants that exist through nature.

**Time's impact**

If you do not return to your garden (or wish it into your cell) then nature may take hold and dissolve your art, or anything that can happen which naturally happens.  The bushes may grow healthy, or perhaps two of the three plants exist after a year has passed, and your art is reduced from a row of three plants to a row of only two plants.  In this case, your art may dissolve forever.  Everything else in nature carries on just as in the real world.  So, if you are knowledgeable about gardening, you understand the proper spacing, and if you (as completely permitted) enhance your odds of your art's survival by watering and other care, then this art remains part of your story.


_I'll need to pause here and continue on another day.  This is the first ever draft of my allegory of the river cell._

## 10.29 Engineering is Magic

Last Halloween I attended a party where the host hired a magician.  The party-goers took a break from the music, pulled up chairs, and watched with so much attention that the cell phones remained in people's costume pockets.  Over a series of tricks, I heard the murmuring periodically of friends chatting about their thoughts of the mechanisms or slight of hand that made the magic happen.  The tricks involved things like matching playing cards, and copying the serial number from a dollar bill without looking at the paper note. I thought to myself, first: it's pretty impressive and it must have taken years of practice to have such consistent results.  He nailed almost every trick without a blooper. Surely he has some of his tougher tricks that he practices off-stage, still improving his skills.  I admired the work.  For a moment I felt a desire to be a magician.  It must feel good. A big applause concluded the 30 minute show, and smiles were everywhere.  

Sometimes I wish that I had an applause, or just a thank-you for my hard work in engineering.  I recall at Toyota I put in TONS of hours to make the exhaust cleaner, the car run smoothly, and maximize power and long engine life for a vehicle that serves tens of thousands of customers - I wished occasionally that I could just tell a stranger how hard I worked on their product, and hear back that they loved the results and it makes them so happy.  

It struck me at the end of the magic show, that engineers basically perform magic.  We create results in real life, and most people have no idea how it works, but they don't stop to discuss amongst each other "how did he do it!!?" with excitement and wonder.  And when we finish the show, the magic keeps on working repeatably for years or decades.  Imagine a group of young mothers in a specialty magic show in 1950.  An engineer walks onto a stage with a magic box.  He places inside the box a whole pile of dirty dishes.  He presses a magic button, and proceeds with the other tricks.  At the end of the show, he opens the magic box and all of the dishes are clean and dry.  It's pure magic!  A box that turns dirty dishes clean!  He would wrap up the show, grab a cold beer, and join the party as the desirable alpha guy who dazzles and charms.  That's how engineering magic works, minus the social side.

Maybe as an engineering educator I can use this concept to help learners have extra pride in their work and realize the whole modern world runs on their efforts.  It would be a kind of social boost I think engineers need to feel as they work and practice.

## 10.23 I want a date with [Ella Marija](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorde)

I was listening to the song "Team" by Lorde this morning and it's almost perfect.  "We live in cities you'll never see on screen.  Not very pretty but we sure know how to run things."  She is originally from New Zealand, with parents from Croatia.  I might not understand the original meaning but that's the beauty of art - it carries meaning for me. Croatia and New Zealand, compared with most of the western world, maintains a gorgeous natural environment instead of building sky-high towers that cast shadows over the beach.  In the developing countries where I have visited - guatemala, brazil, malaysia - the strength of commerce hasn't grown so powerful that it consumes our attention and we completely miss the point of life that's communicated to us with our natural surroundings.  The humans in all of these places are connected and we want the same things.  We just cannot see it.  The developed nations with relaxed economies like New Zealand are gems because they can help us bridge the communication between 1st and 3rd worlds.

"And you know, we're on each other's team" - these words could have resolved every conflict in my life this decade, both personal and in business. If only it were understood by both sides.  I won't go into detail because the lyrics say it all.

In any case, If you know Ella, please tell her I'd like to take her out for dinner.

## 10.22 Trust is Power

We talk about a lot of distrust these days.  I'd claim we implement trust in people 100x more often than we implement distrust, and we don't even notice it most of the time.  But trust enables us to advance a thousand times further than living without trust.  For an example, I'll describe the choice of people who drive cars - when you climb into a car, you're trusting tens of thousands of engineers, technicians, lawmakers, and even writers to keep you safe.  Let's dive in. 

Inside of my 14 year old Toyota 4runner, there are dozens of things that can EXPLODE and cause harm to me.  Here's a list:
* The Fuel in the tank can explode, if any spark is available near the path of the fuel.
* The battery can explode, especially where hydrogen gas can release from the electrolyte fluid.
* The nav display has a lithium battery, and it can explode if punctured.
* There are four tires which can explode from pressure, any rubber puncture, or chemical that weakens the tire.
* There is a spare tire, which can also explode under pressure.
* The oil pan below the engine contains gas fumes, and it can explode if it is struck while driving.
* The head gasket and aluminum heads could explode, if the cylinder pressure is too high.
* There is an airbag directly in my steering wheel, which is designed to explode, but hopefully not at the wrong time.
* There are 4 more airbags that can explode, all with potentially lethal force, in the columns and passenger side.
* At highway speeds, each of the drivetrain elements can explode due to binding or friction, including but not limited to:
  * driveshaft and u-joint
  * rear differential
  * front differential
  * transmission discs
  * wheel bearings
  * (each of the above contains metal heavier than a hammer, rotating at thousands of RPM, with more energy than a lethal bullet, enough to fly off and easily pass through a person.
* The air conditioner contains pressurized aluminum & steel tubes, routing straight into the cabin, carrying VERY high pressure, containing toxic chemicals, and several joints and tubes that can explode.
* I keep a fire extinguisher in the vehicle, which contains high pressure and metal, and could explode if it fails, with toxic chemicals.
* The serpentine belt made of fiber-reinforced synthetic rubber, wrapped around multiple steel discs in the front of the engine, all rotating 10x faster than a kitchen blender blade, and 10x the weight of a baseball, each can explode from rotating energy.
* The exhaust manifold, less than 1 meter from the driver, carrying hundreds of PSI of toxic gasses at 800 degrees fahrenheit, glowing red with heat daily, could explode.
* Each of the four shock absorbers, with cylinders reaching THOUSANDS of PSI at moments of striking a bump, carrying toxic oils, could explode by a seal failure.
* Two rubber tubes in my steering system, the thickness of a sharpie, carrying easily 1200 PSI, and toxic lubricant, could explode due to hose failure.

This is just a 5-minute list of things on the car that could explode under ordinary use, and I am trusting everyone from the design engineers to the technicians to the metallurgists who authored descriptions 50 years ago of how to make the chemistry of the metals that are used to make each part strong enough, still used today in the components that hopefully won't explode.  Just imagine, I could make a list of equal length for the number of ways each component could fail; explosion is only one type of potentially-lethal failure.

Every moment that you live in society, you're trusting thousands of humans to keep you safe, putting your life in the hands of complete strangers, some of whom have passed away many years ago.  Some of them had beliefs you dislike.  Some of them had bad habits you disagree with.  Some of them made remarks that would offend you.  Some of them had a bad temper, some with a criminal record, some doing their jobs amidst a life crisis.  And they put their efforts into creating convenience for you which laid a path for your success.

Somewhere in Guatemala there is a nineteen year old boy in a forest of rubber treees, harvesting liquid sap from the bark of a tree with his bare hands, collecting it into a coffee can that will get poured into a bucket of liquid rubber resin that will go into a truck and make it's way to Goodyear Tire & Rubber company in Topeka, Kansas.  He hasn't finished high school, he has harvested 10,000 sap-cans, he's got to do this to pay for his younger sister to take English classes, to advance enough to MAYBE get a modern education, and he has seen the lavish American lifestyle of complaining about a cracked phone screen on a phone that costs as much as his family's food for the next year, and you are trusting him to NOT contaminate the rubber that goes into that high-pressure hose in your power-steering system in your car which, upon failure, could end your life.  Wow, what an incredible situation of trust.

I think we would regain some faith in humanity if we only _noticed_ how much we trust others.  The trouble is that we are trusting thousands of times per day, but we aren't consciously choosing it.  If we could notice the times we are passively trusting, we could change it to a behavior of actively choosing trust, and engrain the pattern of choosing trust and discovering the rewards.  If you drove to work today and you trusted your vehicle, you can obviously see how the choice of trusting versus walking to work got you there faster and more comfortably.  Let us begin to correlate our success with our trust so that the correlation becomes undeniably obvious!  Everything you have done in your life that you are proud of - it was only made possible through trust.  Maybe with that mindset we could have gratitude for the times we trusted others and it brought us good results.

As my business grows and I see the path it is taking, my results are tenfold greater when I have trusted others. I don't always agree with my colleagues and partners but for every disagreement there are 100 unspoken agreements, and recognizing them makes it clear that all of my power to expand my efforts comes from trusting others.  The more I can manage to trust, the more leverage I have to build new exciting outcomes.  I hope others can see this as well as I can see it. 

## 10.18 We Forgot How to Mechanical Engineer

I believe that americans and many first world countries have completely forgotten how to perform mechanical engineering.  I believe phrases like "this functions like clockwork" comes from the time when we knew how to build clocks, and when any intricate multimaterial, fine-tuned mechanical system was approachable by most mechanical engineers.  I believe that a mechanical engineer who does not build things is like a software engineer who does not write software.  The problem roots in the fact that our economy creates spaces for our engineers to be VERY HIGHLY PAID to specialize so deeply within a machine that their knowledge stops when they exit school, and it is the reason most mechanical engineers do not even repair their own cars and household items.  I intend to help fix this.  I think that countries like India, Russia, Malaysia, and developing nations have highly skilled mechanical engineers who know how to work with ranges of materials & substances, who use a greater fraction of their knowledge, and are able to solve the small problems in society that turn our appliances and machines into landfill stuff.  The economic constraint of having only what is needed (not a massive surplus of cheap goods as we have in the USA) means that high-value materials never arrive on the curb and they make their way into a new function at vastly higher rates than they do in the USA, Singapore, France, Germany, etc.   

Mark my words:  As the [manufacturing economy re-localizes](https://youtu.be/JHDYf18AYfI) to some degree (this is evidenced by many economists) and more products are made locally once again in developed nations, we will have a rise in the cost of goods, appliances will become more coveted once again, and re-use and repair will recover as a part of our society, or in some cases automation will take the place of millions of cheap devices.  In 2019 I found two Keurig coffee machines for free on the curbside: only in America would you find something like this, wherein one [disconnected wire or a leaky tube](https://youtu.be/kLjtxc7-g9E) inside of the machine prevented it from functioning as good as new - and in 2026 we will see this situation replaced with fewer machines.  In path A: the machine prices will rise and become fewer in sales, or path B: the household keurig will subside and be replaced by on-demand coffee delivered by robots, drones, or bulk delivery services.  It is too costly and unsustainable to distribute machines so complex and high in technology components, as these components were manufactured globally and the global workers are earning enough money to change their standard of living.  Chinese laborers are becoming middle class, and more of their inventions will stay in-country.  Shipping routes are becoming expensive and increasing in risk due to situations like the [Panama Canal](https://youtu.be/6GI0zANA3S4) and the [Suez Canal](https://youtu.be/Ty-m4pm8oog) problems recently.  Quality must rise, Quantity must fall, and I hope that our skillsets become more focused on meeting normal needs.

In 2012 my job at Toyota largely revolved around computing costs of component manufacture in the USA, Japan, and Mexico, wherein the logistics cost battled the currency exchange ratios for the tipping point of local or remote parts manufacturing.  As the tipping points slowly move towards reduced exportation (from all nations) and the global impact of shipping becomes burdened with planted-preservation directives, jobs like mine in 2012 will refocus on the mechanical designs instead of computing dollar figures.  I complained heavily to my team that I felt I was not using my engineering skills learned in school.  These issues will slowly adjust.  Engineers who are directed to perform business-engineering instead of mechanical engineering will once again have a space to solve mechanical problems, and this is good.

Through my robotics organization I intend to support this adjustment by publishing more and more educational information that allows experienced and brilliant minds to return to their true skillset: creating value by making solutions in the engineering space instead of in the economics space.  It's going to take a big community and many years but it will be ever-enjoyable and very rewarding. 

## 10.15 What your salary says about you

Salary measures how much you hate your job.  I know folks won't enjoy reading that but hear me out...  The things you enjoy, you do for free:  hug your family, walk your dog, fetch a cool glass of water.  The things you REALLY enjoy, you'll pay money for:  Eat dinner at a high class italian joint, Park in the premium space downtown, take a vacation in Cozumel.  People I know who really love a type of work, such as buiding pottery or writing a blog: they do these activities for no pay at all.  One of my friends at the Toyota Design engineering group back in 2012 had a hefty $80k salary (fresh out of college, 1 year experience), and spent his work week designing parts of transmissions which would later go into the Sienna or the Highlander.  After work, our friends group would socialize at a small bar in Ypsilanti and he would show up later than everyone... on a 30 year old, slow, rickety moped.  I asked about it, and he said he spent the last 3 hours modifying the exhaust pipe of the scooter to get a certain performance out of the tiny 50CC engine.  I couldn't believe that he was engineering by day and continuing engineering by night. How could he work on something so unimportant while he spent his work week doing engineering for vehicles in mass production? The truth is, he didn't really love the time he spent at the desk, but Toyota wouldn't pay him to put on gloves and take engines apart. He loved certain parts of engineering.  And the very specific activities that brought him joy - he would gladly do for free.  Nobody would buy his scooter, nobody would ever even know about the brilliant engineering inside the exhaust port of this one old ugly scooter somewhere in Michigan.  No reward except for the job itself. 

Yesterday my Texan friend spoke of a lawyer he knows who charges $10,000 per hour.  That means 10 seconds of his time costs $27.  He must really hate his job.  Imagine, if he visits his parents and hugs them 10 seconds. Does he charge them the appropriate 54 dollars?  Nobody charges their parents for hugs, so I guess those hugs were worth $57 to him. On the other hand, answering a client's email is worth -$57 to him.  He must really hate emails. He is probably not so unique. Maybe it's time to do more hugging in the world and less emailing.

From a business perspective, an employer asks "how much do I have to pay this person to make them do something?"  When I was 13, I walked up the street to some workers digging up the sewer, fascinated and curious.  (I loved digging holes and perhaps they got closer to China than I did).  Two men had shovels and one man operated the backhoe.  The operator was the only one not sweating.  The men in the trench informed me "If you work like us for 15 years then you get to drive the backhoe, and he gets paid double!"  So today I'm verifying my logic: does that man dislike the backhoe operation twice as much as he disliked shovel-work?  It musn't be so, right?  The truth is he had to offer 15 years of work at a low wage to get his first year in the backhoe.  So, looking at the exchange of 1 year of backhoe-operation - it's actually 15 years of shovel work plus a year of running the machine.  So basically the backhoe payment is a FUTURE payment for the workers with shovels.  The payment is withheld until 15 years. They get to go home tired and sweaty daily and tell their wives that they really should keep going because soon they'll get to do something they like more, and the family will get more cash too.  The shovel workers would switch to the backhoe any day for no extra pay.  But the extra cash is to make it look better on paper, and make it easier for the workers to justify the first 15 years to their friends and family. 

Every minute of your life is equal.  When you reach your death bed you won't talk about your life and your work-life separately. So, what parts of your day do you really enjoy?  Can you make that into a larger part of your life?  Maybe it would make the world a better place.

## 09.05 Embracing Diversity in Language

I was born in 1989 and grew up in the midwest.  Most of us have learned only English in spoken languages, and this fact has been subjected to innumerable discussions as I traveled the world and as years have passed.

Recently, I noticed a friend of mine who is native to Malaysia and speaks Malay (bahasa-melayu) but is fluent in English, some of his spoken words are different than mine and observing this really ties together the challenges of language in my life, mostly rooted in folks making assumptions.  Biases and assumptions are the enemy, not culture differences and language barriers.  For this discussion, let us give the name colleague Nazmi.

In a meeting, Nazmi made a remark like "our team is interacting with the developers of a so-called grocery robot" and I noticed his use of the phrase "so-called." In Missouri (perhaps in North America) his comment would imply that there is not in fact a grocery robot but it carries this title nevertheless. Specifically, it feels that the [predicative nominative](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-predicate-nominative-and-direct-object) of the sentence is not in fact what it is called.  We Americans often make remarks with distain such as "the so-called leader of our country can't even find the podium on his stage."  We intend to say the person carries a title but the title does not carry truth.  

Because of my frequent interactions with Nazmi, I knew that there was no disdain implied, and no doubts about the legitimacy about the grocery robot.  But, I felt an impulse to clarify for the whole group.  Usually I try to be an administrator of clarity but I let it go and I just observed how the others received the comments. It appeared, there was sufficient open-mindedness that folks in the meeting did not become confused and in the following minutes Nazmi used the phrase several more times, with a respectful tone towards the "so-called" this or that.  Nazmi had his own connotations for "so-called" and I realized there is not a rule to be followed.  Instead of offering clarity for others, maybe I need more observation.

Over the years, I think I've learned bits of many languages but more about **human communication** when speaking different flavors of English.  One year of coursework in Japanese, one year of high school spanish, and many years speaking portuguese with my friends and former spouse.  Again and again, I learn from non-native or other-native english speakers **IF** I keep an open mind.

Last week at Lowes I was helped by a worker, born in the middle east.  I asked where he's from.  He said Pakistan.  I told him "Welcome to America." He replied "I've been here thirty years." And with a smile, I replied "I still noticed your accent so I decided to say welcome."  He felt that I was kind and genuine but still made a defense: "It's because I speak three languages, sir."  Later as I drove home, I pondered if I should quit welcoming people who have been here a long time. The risk of such a welcome is that they'll assume I am sarcastic. But in 30 years, don't you think he has sometimes doubted whether he is welcome? Don't you think he deserves some reassurance?  Do you think he will find reassurance on news and social media? If not, then where? I am sure there are pains in his life in America as a middle eastern native. Why should anyone have to make an explanation for having an accent? In the future, if he has more experiences of strangers being warm and accepting of him and simultaneously discussing accents, I bet it will help him realize his accent is a great thing. One cannot heal a pain without going near the topic of the pain.

#### Other bits, to be listed as superficial observations but which I've introspected enough to write a book:
* 2023 In a discussion on reddit where I spoke of diversity, I received insulting remarks among which were an attack of my abilities in writing.  The irony of someone assuming I don't embrace diversity and simultaneously judging my language skillset - this would make a great discussion.  Lesson: we need to reconsider what it means to have an open accepting mind.
* 2018 A german biologist, fluent in English, has corrected my proper English usage in a social barbecue setting.  Her remarks essentially said "you should know better," and "why are my English skills better than those of Americans?" with a presumed conclusion that Americans do not make a strong effort to use our language properly. She was inclined to aim for properness but she was married to a man from Costa Rica who speaks only a bit of English.  He heard the whole interaction.  Lesson: How could he feel accepted while observing his German-native English-speaker delivering judgement of an American's English skillset?
* 2021 In a social setting, a close friend of mine (American) reprimanded me for offering a correction to a Brazilian-native in English.  The Brazilian-native was my wife, and she desired to refine her English as much as possible for her success in developing her career (focused on scientific literature).  For two years I did not make corrections in public because it may be embarrassing.  She and several of my Brazilian friends had expressed frustration that they can't improve from Good-to-great in English because nobody informs them of minor errors.  I opened a new mindset to be willing to make corrections in realtime.  It would seem I can't do this without assumptions made of me. Lesson: In the 3-party interaction, each person can have what they wish for, only if nobody makes assumptions about the goodwill of others.
* 2007 A teenage David had a distaste for popular rap music, which carried themes I disagreed with morally, but also had grammar that would fail in 6th grade American schools.  I **judged** it was garbage. By 2009 in college my peers would make jokes about my utter void in good party music and I defended that it's objectively rubbish, and it's existence was a cultural degradation for listeners, because it's English made no sense. (remember, this was young David). In the same year, I participated in Engineers Without Borders traveling to Guatemala and joyfully embraced the broken English of my counterparts as we engineered clean water for families.  The irony is that my embracing of language had nothing to do with objective properness. It was just a mask for whether I embraced a culture.  *Before one can embrace a culture, they must admit they don't know the culture* and my huge error was believing that Missouri had one culture. I thought that my mind was so very open! Lesson: I assumed Missouri culture was one box, defined by what school teaches. I believed that because I was taught in school that one sentence format was right and one sentence format was wrong.  From there, it was easy to **judge** if a student was doing right or wrong.  It took another 15 years of my own style of open-mindedness for me put these experiences together and adjust my mindset to resolve the cognitive dissonance.  That journey could be a whole book in itself so I will not summarize the lesson today.  Lesson element: don't allow your cultural assumptions into your interpretation of language.

## 08.23 Meal Prep^4

When I'm depressed I don't even have drive to cook for myself.  This year, my best friend (happy David) gave me an awesome gift to help out during those times.  He meal prepped for me, and more. It's really starting to change things.  If you have a best friend as good as mine, ask if they'll help you do things like this.

## 08.21 Welcome to America.

I've spoken these words many times, and occasionally I'm told by Americans that it's offensive. I respect that opinion but I disagree.  Their concern is that it sounds that we have claimed the whole continent in referring to my country. This would be concerning for me too, but I am certainly not claiming the whole continent for my country and I have never met someone who does this, so far.

This phrase is English for "Welcome to the United States of America" in American-English, since Americans often abbreviate their country name when speaking.  The fact that we abbreviate is common knowledge among English native speakers in the USA, Canada, and Europe.  For these people, it's okay to use the phrase because they know it is spoken with kindness - except for a select few who have distain and poor assumptions about Americans and you may enjoy abbreviating just to troll them 🙂.

**Here are some phrases I use to welcome people with consideration for their background:**
* If I wish to welcome a spanish-speaker to the USA, I say "bienvenido a America."
* If I wish to welcome a Mexican spanish-speaker to the USA, I say "bienvenido a Los Estados Unidos." I would not say "bienvenido a America" because they already came from the American continent and that might infer a claim to the continent. If you said this phrase to a Mexican or Latino spanish speaker I agree it may be offensive and I personally don't use that phrase to greet a Latino.
* If I wish to welcome a close friend is Mexican and returning to the USA, I tell them "welcome to America" with a grin and we both understand it is a joke.
* If I wish to welcome a close friend who is Brazilian I use "bem vindo a America" to the same effect.
* If I wish to welcome an acquaintence who is Brazilian I use "welcome to America" with a smile and if she is a woman, with a kiss on the cheek per Brazilian culture (and most latino cultures).  I use body language to show that it is a genuine welcoming and I use the english phrase in my American accent so that they can become familiar with the phrase, and establish if they hear that phrase during the rest of their travel, it has a warm meaning. 
* If I wish to welcome a mexican friend in a professional setting of mostly spanish speakers I use "bienvenido a los Estados Unidos."
* If I wish to welcome a mexican acquaintence in a professional setting of mostly English speakers, I use "welcome to the United States."
* If I wish to welcome an acquaintence from Europe and I do not know what language they speak, I use "welcome to America" so they become familiar with my accent.
* If you wish to welcome an English speaker from Canada to the United States, you can say "welcome to the USA" or "welcome to America." It isn't offensive because in Canada it's common knowledge that US people abbreviate United States of America with just America.
* If I am welcoming a Canadian, I use "welcome to Texas" because they probably already feel welcome in the United States. 
* If I am in latin america and I greet a person who arrived from overseas, I use "welcome to america" or "bienvenido a america" to let them know I am aware America is a continent and that Americans like myself do not claim the word America for the United States.

I have never met an American who claims the whole continent by calling themselves Americans.  If you meet someone who feels that way, I recommend you learn where that feeling comes from and maybe we can help make adjustments.


## 08.21 I woke up and immediately faced an engineering problem.

It's a normal morning. I wake up, and the first thing I have to do is solve an engineering problem:  The problem is aiming a nozzle into a bowl. The nozzle is 44 inches (1.1m) off the ground, pointed 60 degrees above horizontal, and the bowl is 17 inches (0.4m) above the floor; the target is 11 inches (0.3m) in diameter with a horizontal opening. This problem must be solved at 5:30am, in the dark. There's a window nearby, with a base at 48 inches (1.2m) from the floor. From an engineering standpoint, it's easier to purge the nozzle out the window than to purge it into the bowl. I think any engineer would agree.  But for social reasons, it is unacceptable to purge the liquid outside of the home. Actually considering what is socially acceptable, the liquid may only be purged into the original bowl.

I'm a proponent of gender equality but I think mostly males face this problem and I don't know why it has not been solved.  Now I'm reminded of several other problems we have in society that have not been solved very well.

The measurements of the human body for the purpose of design is called anthropometrics. [This PDF](https://lobfile.com/file/LEdg.pdf) features some anthropometric data and the percentiles of the US population. I'll save it here for reference in future discussions.

## 08.14 There are only 2 reasons to jump

Today my close friend messaged me, says she's a little bit sad.  I'm honored to be a safe person to whom she reached out and I thought about her situation.  Just made a move into a new apartment, getting settled, nothing else really changed. And I think I've had the exact same experience before.  If you have ever played Frogger, then you might follow this analogy:

In the game of frogger, there is only one action you can do ► jump.  And there are only two reasons to jump.  The first reason is to take a step towards your goal, and the other reason is to avoid harm.  Just like frogger, life sends problems down our path such as logs and cars and things we don't usually consider problems, just minor events (as adults). If it's time for you to renew your license for example, you must take an action. We don't call it a problem, but it's something that forces you to act, or otherwise face problems.  These get much bigger all the way to having a newborn child and having to equip your home with new furniture for the baby.  

Well, why might you feel sad after you took a jump?  You knew it was required.  You didn't encounter any harm.  But now you are, if you introspect, in a whole new situation. So what is the impact on our psychology?  If all else is equal, you should feel the same as you felt before the jump, but there's an added burden. It's time to reassess the dangers or opportunities. Your mind will subtly be reviewing risks and new tasks required of you, basically a whole 360 scan of what's necessary ► and you have to do it while you keep your remaining life items steady.  It can be taxing.

I have moved apartments many times, and sometimes it is a jump for advancement and sometimes it is a jump by requirement.  The **actions are exactly the same but the psychology is far different.**  Just thinking about this gives me a little bit of consolation and readiness to "go easy on myself" if I just landed a required jump and I feel off.  It's time I note that reassesssing every minor change is actually a big task for a human and if we give credit to ourselves for this effort, we might be able to pivot sadness into a little bit of proudness and self reassurance.  Or, by some strong trickery of the mind, we could convince ourselves that it was a jump for advancement, and that is valid too.  It's your own life.

## 08.14 I almost burned down the house.

I dont always start a fire, but when i do, its because i found a new way to do it.  This time, the lawn sprinkler was too close to the electrical box.

Nobody was hurt, the house is ok, and i consider this a learning experience.  The painful part was losing HVAC for 24 hours and working a 14 hour sunday shift to repair the circuits in 110F texas heat, no clouds, no shade.

My home is from 1976 so the electric equipment is older than me. 47 years.  The outdoor panel was supposed to be waterproof and it was fully closed and locked. Further investigation is needed.

Here are some [photos of the damage](https://imgur.com/a/ux5YFTS)

## 08.12 Every morning, ideas

I'm waking up every morning overflowing with ideas, this month.  About philosophy, engineering, culture, language, business... I can't possibly write them down.  Here is a random one: laser ablation on acrylic round stock.  Fly fishermen and fly makers, jewelry makers, etc: they could have extremely detailed and transparent or glossy, accurate repeatable copies (or unique copies given our digital assets could be parameterized) of insects such as dragonflies and mayflies or whatever type of flies they like to make. The round stock can rotate and the laser scans, and they could actually build many copies in a matter of a minute if it works as fast as we can cut 1/4 inch acrylic sheets.  Extreme accuracy and detail, better than what we get with 3d printers currently.  And the true transparent color of acrylics is an asset for coloring as we wish.

## 08.11 Do you work for your tools?

Finally a nice way to describe the purpose of all my over-the-top organization.  The epitome of organization is that you don't work for your tools - your tools work for you.  Consider the things you own.  A screwdriver.  A broom.  A hack saw. Even a drinking glass.  Each of these, we can call a tool because it's a means to get something done.  To answer the question of who works for who, it is simple:  Do you spend more time handling the item or using the item?

The journey of the drinking glass.  Let's say I want a coffee and a half glass of orange juice for the morning.   The drinking glass does it's job while it's putting orange juice in my mouth.  The rest of the journey is: I set it in the sink.  I wash it at some point.  I dry it and set it on a drying rack.  It may air dry, or I need the space and I dry it manually.  I put it on the shelf.  I retrieve it from the shelf.  The tasks are stacking up quickly.  If the shelf is cluttered, I adjust other glasses to fit it in the shelf.  If there was a dishwasher involved, it went into the dishwasher and came back out.  If it's one of those terrible cups that has a bottom rim, I shake the water off and wipe it dry with a towel, then it goes to the shelf.  If the shelf has a door, I open the door.  If the door hinge isn't auto-closing, I close it.

When you add up all the handling tasks, it easily surpasses the time I spent with my lips to the cup.  So, we have an epic failure in my mind.  I paid money for a thing, and then I worked for the thing.  Lose-lose.  And if it's a thing I use daily, it's an eternal cycle of spending more time giving than receiving what I wanted.  The more you own, the more you work for your things.  In modern life you can easily consume all of your time workign for things after you've already bought them.  

There are a couple of ways out.  The first way, is to buy more stuff to make it easier.  A better dishwasher that dries things.  A deeper sink that holds more stuff.  Fancier cabinet doors that swing shut.  A classy rinse aid in your dishwasher so you've got no spots.  Buy Buy Buy.  If you pay attention, you'll find that your purchases end up doing the same as the item that caused you labor.  The rinse aid didn't fit under the sink, so you journey to the garage to store it, and journey back to use it.  You journey to the store to buy more, or you journey online to order it, and when it comes in the mail you journey to find a tool to unbox it.  This is the way of the modern economy.  Buy more stuff.  Become momentarily happy.  Wish daily that you had better stuff, and spend enough time online to get advertisements for the solutions - the next stuff. 

The second way out:  Study yourself.  Notice where you spend your time.  Adjust your things, the layout, your habits, until your stuff starts working for you.  Purge stuff that serves you less than it costs you.  Simplify.  Go back to basics.  The more I do this, the more I find my solutions at dollar tree.  The complexity of life is reversing.  More time for leisure.  More time for family and doing the things I love.

And imagine, with a little bit of skill and a few tools, you can begin to adjust your own stuff to make it suit you.  The first thing I did when I moved into my kitchen was remove the doors from the cabinet I access most. It cost me 2 minutes with a screwdriver and it saved me hours by now.  Not exaggerating.  The removal of the door means airflow.  Airflow means I can put away the dishes wet, and they dry in place.  I don't even use the drying rack anymore.  Less steps for everything.

## severe weather 08.09
wow the heat in bryan is intense.  I had to make repairs to the AC and found a few leaks.  Earlier this week it was running nonstop and multiple rooms couldn't reach below 77F.  Now I've installed some additional insulation and repaired the insulation on the ducts in the attic.  Looks like the AC can keep up much better.
