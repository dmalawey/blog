## 10.15 What your salary says about you

Salary measures how much you hate your job.  I know folks won't enjoy reading that but hear me out...  The things you enjoy, you do for free:  hug your family, walk your dog, fetch a cool glass of water.  The things you REALLY enjoy, you'll pay money for:  Eat dinner at a high class italian joint, Park in the premium space downtown, take a vacation in Cozumel.  People I know who really love a type of work, such as buiding pottery or writing a blog: they do these activities for no pay at all.  One of my friends at the Toyota Design engineering group back in 2012 had a hefty $80k salary (fresh out of college, 1 year experience), and spent his work week designing parts of transmissions which would later go into the Sienna or the Highlander.  After work, our friends group would socialize at a small bar in Ypsilanti and he would show up later than everyone... on a 30 year old, slow, rickety moped.  I asked about it, and he said he spent the last 3 hours modifying the exhaust pipe of the scooter to get a certain performance out of the tiny 50CC engine.  I couldn't believe that he was engineering by day and continuing engineering by night. How could he work on something so unimportant while he spent his work week doing engineering for vehicles in mass production? The truth is, he didn't really love the time he spent at the desk, but Toyota wouldn't pay him to put on gloves and take engines apart. He loved certain parts of engineering.  And the very specific activities that brought him joy - he would gladly do for free.  Nobody would buy his scooter, nobody would ever even know about the brilliant engineering inside the exhaust port of this one old ugly scooter somewhere in Michigan.  No reward except for the job itself. 

Yesterday my Texan friend spoke of a lawyer he knows who charges $10,000 per hour.  That means 10 seconds of his time costs $27.  He must really hate his job.  Imagine, if he visits his parents and hugs them 10 seconds. Does he charge them the appropriate 54 dollars?  Nobody charges their parents for hugs, so I guess those hugs were worth $57 to him. On the other hand, answering a client's email is worth -$57 to him.  He must really hate emails. He is probably not so unique. Maybe it's time to do more hugging in the world and less emailing.

From a business perspective, an employer asks "how much do I have to pay this person to make them do something?"  When I was 13, I walked up the street to some workers digging up the sewer, fascinated and curious.  (I loved digging holes and perhaps they got closer to China than I did).  Two men had shovels and one man operated the backhoe.  The operator was the only one not sweating.  The men in the trench informed me "If you work like us for 15 years then you get to drive the backhoe, and he gets paid double!"  So today I'm verifying my logic: does that man dislike the backhoe operation twice as much as he disliked shovel-work?  It musn't be so, right?  The truth is he had to offer 15 years of work at a low wage to get his first year in the backhoe.  So, looking at the exchange of 1 year of backhoe-operation - it's actually 15 years of shovel work plus a year of running the machine.  So basically the backhoe payment is a FUTURE payment for the workers with shovels.  The payment is withheld until 15 years. They get to go home tired and sweaty daily and tell their wives that they really should keep going because soon they'll get to do something they like more, and the family will get more cash too.  The shovel workers would switch to the backhoe any day for no extra pay.  But the extra cash is to make it look better on paper, and make it easier for the workers to justify the first 15 years to their friends and family. 

Every minute of your life is equal.  When you reach your death bed you won't talk about your life and your work-life separately. So, what parts of your day do you really enjoy?  Can you make that into a larger part of your life?  Maybe it would make the world a better place.

## 09.05 Embracing Diversity in Language

I was born in 1989 and grew up in the midwest.  Most of us have learned only English in spoken languages, and this fact has been subjected to innumerable discussions as I traveled the world and as years have passed.

Recently, I noticed a friend of mine who is native to Malaysia and speaks Malay (bahasa-melayu) but is fluent in English, some of his spoken words are different than mine and observing this really ties together the challenges of language in my life, mostly rooted in folks making assumptions.  Biases and assumptions are the enemy, not culture differences and language barriers.  For this discussion, let us give the name colleague Nazmi.

In a meeting, Nazmi made a remark like "our team is interacting with the developers of a so-called grocery robot" and I noticed his use of the phrase "so-called." In Missouri (perhaps in North America) his comment would imply that there is not in fact a grocery robot but it carries this title nevertheless. Specifically, it feels that the [predicative nominative](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-predicate-nominative-and-direct-object) of the sentence is not in fact what it is called.  We Americans often make remarks with distain such as "the so-called leader of our country can't even find the podium on his stage."  We intend to say the person carries a title but the title does not carry truth.  

Because of my frequent interactions with Nazmi, I knew that there was no disdain implied, and no doubts about the legitimacy about the grocery robot.  But, I felt an impulse to clarify for the whole group.  Usually I try to be an administrator of clarity but I let it go and I just observed how the others received the comments. It appeared, there was sufficient open-mindedness that folks in the meeting did not become confused and in the following minutes Nazmi used the phrase several more times, with a respectful tone towards the "so-called" this or that.  Nazmi had his own connotations for "so-called" and I realized there is not a rule to be followed.  Instead of offering clarity for others, maybe I need more observation.

Over the years, I think I've learned bits of many languages but more about **human communication** when speaking different flavors of English.  One year of coursework in Japanese, one year of high school spanish, and many years speaking portuguese with my friends and former spouse.  Again and again, I learn from non-native or other-native english speakers **IF** I keep an open mind.

Last week at Lowes I was helped by a worker, born in the middle east.  I asked where he's from.  He said Pakistan.  I told him "Welcome to America." He replied "I've been here thirty years." And with a smile, I replied "I still noticed your accent so I decided to say welcome."  He felt that I was kind and genuine but still made a defense: "It's because I speak three languages, sir."  Later as I drove home, I pondered if I should quit welcoming people who have been here a long time. The risk of such a welcome is that they'll assume I am sarcastic. But in 30 years, don't you think he has sometimes doubted whether he is welcome? Don't you think he deserves some reassurance?  Do you think he will find reassurance on news and social media? If not, then where? I am sure there are pains in his life in America as a middle eastern native. Why should anyone have to make an explanation for having an accent? In the future, if he has more experiences of strangers being warm and accepting of him and simultaneously discussing accents, I bet it will help him realize his accent is a great thing. One cannot heal a pain without going near the topic of the pain.

#### Other bits, to be listed as superficial observations but which I've introspected enough to write a book:
* 2023 In a discussion on reddit where I spoke of diversity, I received insulting remarks among which were an attack of my abilities in writing.  The irony of someone assuming I don't embrace diversity and simultaneously judging my language skillset - this would make a great discussion.  Lesson: we need to reconsider what it means to have an open accepting mind.
* 2018 A german biologist, fluent in English, has corrected my proper English usage in a social barbecue setting.  Her remarks essentially said "you should know better," and "why are my English skills better than those of Americans?" with a presumed conclusion that Americans do not make a strong effort to use our language properly. She was inclined to aim for properness but she was married to a man from Costa Rica who speaks only a bit of English.  He heard the whole interaction.  Lesson: How could he feel accepted while observing his German-native English-speaker delivering judgement of an American's English skillset?
* 2021 In a social setting, a close friend of mine (American) reprimanded me for offering a correction to a Brazilian-native in English.  The Brazilian-native was my wife, and she desired to refine her English as much as possible for her success in developing her career (focused on scientific literature).  For two years I did not make corrections in public because it may be embarrassing.  She and several of my Brazilian friends had expressed frustration that they can't improve from Good-to-great in English because nobody informs them of minor errors.  I opened a new mindset to be willing to make corrections in realtime.  It would seem I can't do this without assumptions made of me. Lesson: In the 3-party interaction, each person can have what they wish for, only if nobody makes assumptions about the goodwill of others.
* 2007 A teenage David had a distaste for popular rap music, which carried themes I disagreed with morally, but also had grammar that would fail in 6th grade American schools.  I **judged** it was garbage. By 2009 in college my peers would make jokes about my utter void in good party music and I defended that it's objectively rubbish, and it's existence was a cultural degradation for listeners, because it's English made no sense. (remember, this was young David). In the same year, I participated in Engineers Without Borders traveling to Guatemala and joyfully embraced the broken English of my counterparts as we engineered clean water for families.  The irony is that my embracing of language had nothing to do with objective properness. It was just a mask for whether I embraced a culture.  *Before one can embrace a culture, they must admit they don't know the culture* and my huge error was believing that Missouri had one culture. I thought that my mind was so very open! Lesson: I assumed Missouri culture was one box, defined by what school teaches. I believed that because I was taught in school that one sentence format was right and one sentence format was wrong.  From there, it was easy to **judge** if a student was doing right or wrong.  It took another 15 years of my own style of open-mindedness for me put these experiences together and adjust my mindset to resolve the cognitive dissonance.  That journey could be a whole book in itself so I will not summarize the lesson today.  Lesson element: don't allow your cultural assumptions into your interpretation of language.

## 08.23 Meal Prep^4

When I'm depressed I don't even have drive to cook for myself.  This year, my best friend (happy David) gave me an awesome gift to help out during those times.  He meal prepped for me, and more. It's really starting to change things.  If you have a best friend as good as mine, ask if they'll help you do things like this.

## 08.21 Welcome to America.

I've spoken these words many times, and occasionally I'm told by Americans that it's offensive. I respect that opinion but I disagree.  Their concern is that it sounds that we have claimed the whole continent in referring to my country. This would be concerning for me too, but I am certainly not claiming the whole continent for my country and I have never met someone who does this, so far.

This phrase is English for "Welcome to the United States of America" in American-English, since Americans often abbreviate their country name when speaking.  The fact that we abbreviate is common knowledge among English native speakers in the USA, Canada, and Europe.  For these people, it's okay to use the phrase because they know it is spoken with kindness - except for a select few who have distain and poor assumptions about Americans and you may enjoy abbreviating just to troll them 🙂.

**Here are some phrases I use to welcome people with consideration for their background:**
* If I wish to welcome a spanish-speaker to the USA, I say "bienvenido a America."
* If I wish to welcome a Mexican spanish-speaker to the USA, I say "bienvenido a Los Estados Unidos." I would not say "bienvenido a America" because they already came from the American continent and that might infer a claim to the continent. If you said this phrase to a Mexican or Latino spanish speaker I agree it may be offensive and I personally don't use that phrase to greet a Latino.
* If I wish to welcome a close friend is Mexican and returning to the USA, I tell them "welcome to America" with a grin and we both understand it is a joke.
* If I wish to welcome a close friend who is Brazilian I use "bem vindo a America" to the same effect.
* If I wish to welcome an acquaintence who is Brazilian I use "welcome to America" with a smile and if she is a woman, with a kiss on the cheek per Brazilian culture (and most latino cultures).  I use body language to show that it is a genuine welcoming and I use the english phrase in my American accent so that they can become familiar with the phrase, and establish if they hear that phrase during the rest of their travel, it has a warm meaning. 
* If I wish to welcome a mexican friend in a professional setting of mostly spanish speakers I use "bienvenido a los Estados Unidos."
* If I wish to welcome a mexican acquaintence in a professional setting of mostly English speakers, I use "welcome to the United States."
* If I wish to welcome an acquaintence from Europe and I do not know what language they speak, I use "welcome to America" so they become familiar with my accent.
* If you wish to welcome an English speaker from Canada to the United States, you can say "welcome to the USA" or "welcome to America." It isn't offensive because in Canada it's common knowledge that US people abbreviate United States of America with just America.
* If I am welcoming a Canadian, I use "welcome to Texas" because they probably already feel welcome in the United States. 
* If I am in latin america and I greet a person who arrived from overseas, I use "welcome to america" or "bienvenido a america" to let them know I am aware America is a continent and that Americans like myself do not claim the word America for the United States.

I have never met an American who claims the whole continent by calling themselves Americans.  If you meet someone who feels that way, I recommend you learn where that feeling comes from and maybe we can help make adjustments.


## 08.21 I woke up and immediately faced an engineering problem.

It's a normal morning. I wake up, and the first thing I have to do is solve an engineering problem:  The problem is aiming a nozzle into a bowl. The nozzle is 44 inches (1.1m) off the ground, pointed 60 degrees above horizontal, and the bowl is 17 inches (0.4m) above the floor; the target is 11 inches (0.3m) in diameter with a horizontal opening. This problem must be solved at 5:30am, in the dark. There's a window nearby, with a base at 48 inches (1.2m) from the floor. From an engineering standpoint, it's easier to purge the nozzle out the window than to purge it into the bowl. I think any engineer would agree.  But for social reasons, it is unacceptable to purge the liquid outside of the home. Actually considering what is socially acceptable, the liquid may only be purged into the original bowl.

I'm a proponent of gender equality but I think mostly males face this problem and I don't know why it has not been solved.  Now I'm reminded of several other problems we have in society that have not been solved very well.

The measurements of the human body for the purpose of design is called anthropometrics. [This PDF](https://lobfile.com/file/LEdg.pdf) features some anthropometric data and the percentiles of the US population. I'll save it here for reference in future discussions.

## 08.14 There are only 2 reasons to jump

Today my close friend messaged me, says she's a little bit sad.  I'm honored to be a safe person to whom she reached out and I thought about her situation.  Just made a move into a new apartment, getting settled, nothing else really changed. And I think I've had the exact same experience before.  If you have ever played Frogger, then you might follow this analogy:

In the game of frogger, there is only one action you can do ► jump.  And there are only two reasons to jump.  The first reason is to take a step towards your goal, and the other reason is to avoid harm.  Just like frogger, life sends problems down our path such as logs and cars and things we don't usually consider problems, just minor events (as adults). If it's time for you to renew your license for example, you must take an action. We don't call it a problem, but it's something that forces you to act, or otherwise face problems.  These get much bigger all the way to having a newborn child and having to equip your home with new furniture for the baby.  

Well, why might you feel sad after you took a jump?  You knew it was required.  You didn't encounter any harm.  But now you are, if you introspect, in a whole new situation. So what is the impact on our psychology?  If all else is equal, you should feel the same as you felt before the jump, but there's an added burden. It's time to reassess the dangers or opportunities. Your mind will subtly be reviewing risks and new tasks required of you, basically a whole 360 scan of what's necessary ► and you have to do it while you keep your remaining life items steady.  It can be taxing.

I have moved apartments many times, and sometimes it is a jump for advancement and sometimes it is a jump by requirement.  The **actions are exactly the same but the psychology is far different.**  Just thinking about this gives me a little bit of consolation and readiness to "go easy on myself" if I just landed a required jump and I feel off.  It's time I note that reassesssing every minor change is actually a big task for a human and if we give credit to ourselves for this effort, we might be able to pivot sadness into a little bit of proudness and self reassurance.  Or, by some strong trickery of the mind, we could convince ourselves that it was a jump for advancement, and that is valid too.  It's your own life.

## 08.14 I almost burned down the house.

I dont always start a fire, but when i do, its because i found a new way to do it.  This time, the lawn sprinkler was too close to the electrical box.

Nobody was hurt, the house is ok, and i consider this a learning experience.  The painful part was losing HVAC for 24 hours and working a 14 hour sunday shift to repair the circuits in 110F texas heat, no clouds, no shade.

My home is from 1976 so the electric equipment is older than me. 47 years.  The outdoor panel was supposed to be waterproof and it was fully closed and locked. Further investigation is needed.

Here are some [photos of the damage](https://imgur.com/a/ux5YFTS)

## 08.12 Every morning, ideas

I'm waking up every morning overflowing with ideas, this month.  About philosophy, engineering, culture, language, business... I can't possibly write them down.  Here is a random one: laser ablation on acrylic round stock.  Fly fishermen and fly makers, jewelry makers, etc: they could have extremely detailed and transparent or glossy, accurate repeatable copies (or unique copies given our digital assets could be parameterized) of insects such as dragonflies and mayflies or whatever type of flies they like to make. The round stock can rotate and the laser scans, and they could actually build many copies in a matter of a minute if it works as fast as we can cut 1/4 inch acrylic sheets.  Extreme accuracy and detail, better than what we get with 3d printers currently.  And the true transparent color of acrylics is an asset for coloring as we wish.

## 08.11 Do you work for your tools?

Finally a nice way to describe the purpose of all my over-the-top organization.  The epitome of organization is that you don't work for your tools - your tools work for you.  Consider the things you own.  A screwdriver.  A broom.  A hack saw. Even a drinking glass.  Each of these, we can call a tool because it's a means to get something done.  To answer the question of who works for who, it is simple:  Do you spend more time handling the item or using the item?

The journey of the drinking glass.  Let's say I want a coffee and a half glass of orange juice for the morning.   The drinking glass does it's job while it's putting orange juice in my mouth.  The rest of the journey is: I set it in the sink.  I wash it at some point.  I dry it and set it on a drying rack.  It may air dry, or I need the space and I dry it manually.  I put it on the shelf.  I retrieve it from the shelf.  The tasks are stacking up quickly.  If the shelf is cluttered, I adjust other glasses to fit it in the shelf.  If there was a dishwasher involved, it went into the dishwasher and came back out.  If it's one of those terrible cups that has a bottom rim, I shake the water off and wipe it dry with a towel, then it goes to the shelf.  If the shelf has a door, I open the door.  If the door hinge isn't auto-closing, I close it.

When you add up all the handling tasks, it easily surpasses the time I spent with my lips to the cup.  So, we have an epic failure in my mind.  I paid money for a thing, and then I worked for the thing.  Lose-lose.  And if it's a thing I use daily, it's an eternal cycle of spending more time giving than receiving what I wanted.  The more you own, the more you work for your things.  In modern life you can easily consume all of your time workign for things after you've already bought them.  

There are a couple of ways out.  The first way, is to buy more stuff to make it easier.  A better dishwasher that dries things.  A deeper sink that holds more stuff.  Fancier cabinet doors that swing shut.  A classy rinse aid in your dishwasher so you've got no spots.  Buy Buy Buy.  If you pay attention, you'll find that your purchases end up doing the same as the item that caused you labor.  The rinse aid didn't fit under the sink, so you journey to the garage to store it, and journey back to use it.  You journey to the store to buy more, or you journey online to order it, and when it comes in the mail you journey to find a tool to unbox it.  This is the way of the modern economy.  Buy more stuff.  Become momentarily happy.  Wish daily that you had better stuff, and spend enough time online to get advertisements for the solutions - the next stuff. 

The second way out:  Study yourself.  Notice where you spend your time.  Adjust your things, the layout, your habits, until your stuff starts working for you.  Purge stuff that serves you less than it costs you.  Simplify.  Go back to basics.  The more I do this, the more I find my solutions at dollar tree.  The complexity of life is reversing.  More time for leisure.  More time for family and doing the things I love.

And imagine, with a little bit of skill and a few tools, you can begin to adjust your own stuff to make it suit you.  The first thing I did when I moved into my kitchen was remove the doors from the cabinet I access most. It cost me 2 minutes with a screwdriver and it saved me hours by now.  Not exaggerating.  The removal of the door means airflow.  Airflow means I can put away the dishes wet, and they dry in place.  I don't even use the drying rack anymore.  Less steps for everything.

## severe weather 08.09
wow the heat in bryan is intense.  I had to make repairs to the AC and found a few leaks.  Earlier this week it was running nonstop and multiple rooms couldn't reach below 77F.  Now I've installed some additional insulation and repaired the insulation on the ducts in the attic.  Looks like the AC can keep up much better.
