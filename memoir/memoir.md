# Preface

The story of my life is something I could not imagine when I was growing up.  I was sure I was so unremarkable, like a tree in a forest of people on the planet.  And by age 34, I am realizing the reason it is remarkable is due to the interactions with other people, and the perfection of timing and essence granted to each joy and suffering that has taken place.

I messaged my mother yesterday, "this year it seems that my eyes are getting opened and my life was a book of pages, each day another turn of a page and until this moment, I only had the opportunity to read the front side of each page; the odd pages.  And now, I have been granted access to the back side, and all of the even pages appeared.  Just spending time alone, any time I am in peace I can review the old pages and begin reading the even ones in between.  

Because of this, I thought things had slowed down this year and that I could begin writing - nobody will understand my behaviors and my decisions if they don't understand my story, right?  But each time I sit down to explain in writing, a new page opens and I am again in mid-journey. 

Here is the strategy I will attempt:  I will just begin writing factual pieces, at the moments I can recall them.   I'll write the book and publish it in realtime, and make my edits in realtime.  Github (this utility online) can track every change so if you desired to know what has been edited, you can see each and every change.

I hope that if anyone is following along, they are a person of trust - it is going to be very vulnerable to begin writing without having passed it all through and editor and reviewing for mistakes.  But, it's an experiment, and I only live once so let's try it.
