## 02.08 Irreducible Complexity

From a discussion with my dad yesterday, here's a video that demonstrates what scientists call irreducible complexity.  There are living molecules inside of our bodies that operate our nano-scale bodily functions, and they cannot be explained by evolution.  This is called a "flagellum" or a "flagellar motor" which gives mobility to a protein-based worker in our cells.   The motor is perhaps the smallest operating motor one can conceive, where the molecules, if misarranged by any amount, would no longer function.  So, in order for life to continue, these proteins must keep their precise design. (pardon me if I'm using the wrong terms).  If the design is changed to add a feature, it may work, but if it is changed to remove any feature, it breaks entirely and the concept of evolution cannot be applied to generate this machine.  The work done by evolution is incremental but there are no previous increments that would survive.  I think it's absolutely amazing, and I think the examinations here are solid science.

## 12.29  Old music escalates in meaning

Today I was cleaning the house and some old music from college days came on.  As I enjoyed the music and the comedy (it was Lonely Island) things began to hit me incredibly hard.  Andy Sanberg is the singer and he's known for Anticomedy, based on wikipedia's article.  He's about a decade older than myself and it seems he was perfectly positioned to crank out music that reached millions of listens and simultaneously make an intensive criticism of our entire modern culture here in the USA.  The sattire, or the criticism would only be understood if you are inclined towards a certain set of thoughts about what you see and hear in the media, coming from the 80's, 90's and 2000's. 

[Threw it on the ground - Lyrics](https://www.google.com/search?q=threw+it+on+the+ground+lyrics&sca_esv=7e628e7dbaa3e60f)
I had a thousand thoughts and emotions when this song came on and I heard the lyrics here just after christmas 2020 - everything is intensified after living overseas and returning to our american bubble, realizing how much we've amplified the importance of the most foolish citizens through pop culture. 

Using sattire, and very subtle connections is perfect for this song's lyrics.  To begin approaching a position as a critic to our modern culture, you'd be heard but you'd never reach the audience who's falling for the disturbing reality out there.  The folks in their teens and 20's while Andy was in his 30's would only ever notice his music if TLI did it this way (the lonely island).  By creating music instead of writing, the message goes out the same channels as where the listeners are already gathered - on the radio & pop tv. Then, in the lyrics (and even the styling, rhythm, structure, and vocals) they make a laughing stock out of the very ideas that are broadcast to the young voting population in the USA.  It's so brilliant.  I could break it down in so many more ways to describe the cleverness but I'll keep this memo short as usual.

Note for next time:  I really want to write a narrative that goes line-for-line with Threw it on the Ground and describe what immediately sprouts in my head as to what they are criticising, with examples of artists who made millions of dollars selling an empty message.  Alas I'll wrap it up here and leave that for next time.  Now, at least I have an earmark on the song, lyrics, and the purpose of the analysis to share.


## 12.21 Memo to Younger Engineer

I'm writing a quick memo that unfolds a feedback which I received as an associate engineer (actually as an intern) and which took me about 5 years to understand.  I'm sharing this because I can see the same quality in my friend as the quality that earned me this feedback.  The feedback was substantial.  In my 6 month coop at Goodyear Tire & Rubber in Topeka, I was a junior-level mechanical engineering student with a LOT of hands-on experience such as working on cars, swapping engines, etc.  I was pretty capable but the feedback was a negative item.  It said "David dives into solutions too quickly, needs to take more time to understand the problem."  This was after I finished the coop and returned to missouri, that I started to evaluate.  How can an engineer solve a problem too quickly?  Well over a decade later, I'm able to expand on this and explain it quite precisely.  Engineers love to offer solutions, solicited or not.  How can it hurt to offer a solution too early, even if the problem isn't understood?  Isn't it an opportunity?  If the young engineer offers an unfit solution, isn't that a great chance for the experienced person to explain the weakness of the proposal?  Well, not always.  In manufacturing, every action is based on a chain of processes with dozens of downstream results taking place based on earlier processes.  If there's a suggested improvement on step 1 of a 10-step process, it could be offered without knolwedge of all of the impacts and fine details downstream, some of which are crucial.  At that time, we'd love to just take years of experience and pack them into a clear answer and pass it to the newcomer, but thats a huge effort.  To try to explain how an early process impacts all of the later processes could be a reporting task that takes a year in itself.  So, the young engineer basically is asking for answers that create more tasks.  The team would love to answer all of the questions, but it's very costly to transform the knolwedge into an explanation.  So then, the team leader would be continually tasked with making a partial effort to explain things, and generate explanations for the first time which formerly were only derived from experience.  So, if the young engineer suggests items periodically, it is normal.  But if the young engineer has a characteristic urgency like mine, to discover and find answers quickly, then it's a tax on the team.  Everything lies on a spectrum of course and it's not a black-and-white feedback to say the intern needs to slow down their problem-solving attempts. 

Last bit: Toyota solves this problem by handing a template problem-solving process to all of the engineers in the company.  They demonstrate as soon as you walk into the door that solving any given problem that's worth solving, and which lies in the context of a huge manufacturing process, is a minimum 1-year task.  There's a sort of "graduation" from this school of thought offered for the engineers called the "TBP" or toyota business practice.  So in my first year at toyota I discovered that if I want to be a hero and create new solutions in this company, it may be an intensive effort.  And it was.  I'll tell the story sometime of how I spent 6 months evaluating a flywheel design item.  It was the bolt on of one car's engine's flywheel.  Actually it was just the coating.  Actually it was just an adjustment of coatings.  And actually it was the an adjustment to the specification of the threadlok.  And actually it was the very same threadlock with the same spec but with a new formulation by the exact same company by the exact same team, simply for the supplier company to update their formulations for better chemichal safety.  The most tiny tiny detail of a change.  And, since the testing was intensive and the impacts had to be traced 10 years through to forsee the engine condition after 10 years, I could not generate a sufficient test result to confirm we would be able to change the coatings.  Basically, an engineer with tons of hands-on experience, and after graduating top of his class, still failed to make this small of a change, with a whole 6 months dedicated.  That very same student was used to solving problems in only 5 minutes.  So, without understanding the intensive global possible impacts of a tiny detail, we are likely to be in a mode of rushing solutions, and the behavior is quite common and usually corrected in just a year of exposure to the real world of design & manufacturing.


## 12.20  Tragedy of Creative Loss

When I grew up I was fascinated by stories about Henry Ford, Leonardo DaVinci, Benjamin Franklin, and the likes.  They were clever and creative.  My parents enjoyed their childrens creativity, and certainly supported it as a positive trait. By the time I reached 10th grade I was thinking about my career path after high school and it only took a brief examination to decide what I'll be.  The inventors that were so cool were engineers, and sometimes artists.  To me, engineering meant solving problems and using creativity to generate new ideas.  If you hold that thought, then call to mind the world's definition of engineering today, in 2024, we don't associate them much with creativity.  What's worse, is I've never in my life seen a job description or job application form asking for an engineer who has creativity as an asset for a company.  Certainly there are plenty of reasons for this.  We could all agree that it's not highly practical to sprinkle creativity into today's modern and highly strict design standards for safety and efficiency.  But it isn't right.  It is an utter failure on the part of our society, that we constricted business operations so heavily that the creative minds who also carry a skillset of creative output, that it feels nearly an endangerment to one's career if they are a successful engineer and were to take up space on their resume with a discussion of creativity.  As usual, as I write I find a hundred more thoughts that deserve elaboration on this topic but the goal was just, at this stage, to get the concept out in writing so it can find an opportunity to be expanded once again.  In my present mission to open source a thousand new possibilities for designers and inventors, this might become more and more focal.  We value creativity.  And instead of art getting in the way of good outcomes, we will find ways as a community to unleash the joy of creativity back into the world of inventing and engineering.

## 04.06 Choosing Free Will

"I'd pass on that." (store this quote for later).

This month I caught up a bit with a long-time friend.  It's been over 5 years since the time I'd say "this is the best year of my life" and it is probably the same for him.  We both have some major items not going the way we'd wish.  And, there's no clear path towards a thriving future.  With a sober mind I can say that back when there was such a clarity, it was just an illusion.  The limited wisdom of being in one's twenties.  A simple example is in our 20's we saw "wow in a couple years I could own a home" and now we are both in fact homeowners, and the asset itself brings burdens of different flavors. You could say these boys got what they wanted and learned they couldn't handle it, or you could say these boys got what they wanted and advanced to the next step, which is learning how to handle it for the next time.

Regarding the quote from the start: I made a choice, it yielded some suffering, and a respected friend tells me they would have opted out of the path I chose - it calls for thought.  We're both smart enough to recognize risks.  I have to decide if I've made a dumb decision or a wise one.  It is not easy.  If you played a sport and got injured twice in a season - do you listen to the voice that says "learn your lesson and stop this" or the one that says "figure out the new lesson and try again?"

As we talked, the topic of free will came up and I think the two topics are related at a deep level. That is, how we learn from suffering relates to how we perceive the barriers in life.  Pet dogs are a great analogy for free will so that will be included.  The dog on the leash has a small radius of freewill.  Few risks, few rewards.  The dog in a fenced yard has a larger one.  He can get into more trouble - he can also enjoy more of life's offerings.  Then, there's the runaway dog.  Anything is possible.  Including the biggest dangers, like getting struck by a car.   Life is no different.  We are quite free but we bump into consequences when we pursue paths.  We get hurt.  Finances can hurt.  Health can hurt.  Fading relationships can hurt.  If we take a small risk and get hurt, we get to choose the lesson.  If the lesson is "don't try that again, it's a red light for that road and every road beyond it,"  we can accumulate these red lights inside the mind, and we will become gradually certain that we're confined to a small town.  It's the town of familiarity, where all the risks are inscribed neatly with information and we can navigate about without too much pain.  The red lights at the periphery of the town are "most certainly not good options," and they have a familiar essence that spells "this is not recommended by life" in our mind. If we find a new road out of the town, and there's no red light, we sense the familiar entry ramp, familiar forested backdrop, familiar things reminiscent of the recent red-lit exits, and we are, by that time, programmed to avoid the risk. We can see even the red light which doesn't exist.  I feel as though this stage in our 30's is the perfect time to decide if we want the full power of our free will, or not.

[This video captures](https://youtu.be/pH4CNUMsNOI) Jim Rohn's famous segment about life's risks, and it ties in neatly.  I'm choosing to take this to heart instead of recoil from suffering.

There's no intention to belittle the heaviness of things going persistently wrong in life.  There's no shame in taking a break, and parking in the safe place for some time.  I admit, a host of complications and deeper suffering takes a ride with each of us on our journey. But I desire for myself and my loved ones to keep questioning lessons, long after they happen.  Not to accumulate a calcified heart that limits our joy.  And then, to know where they encounter a red light or just a new road that may lead to a new freedom.

## 03.23 Sacrificial Heifer???

Posting notes here about some current and historic events that I stumbled on this week, which are quite fascinating.

I watched a handfull of videos about modern Israel recently and I'll just drop off the key points here because it is so easy to mix it up:
1. The Israeli people had no state from year 70 to 1948 when they gained an independent nation.  In year 70 the Romans cast them out.
2. 1948 fulfilled a prophesy in their scripture indicating Jews would regain a nation to call home, (from scripture dating from before year 0.)
3. The center of their holy land is the "Temple Mount" where there's currently a an Islamic Mosque built where their last temple was destroyed.
4. The Jews currently plan to rebuild their temple, which would be the 3rd temple in history, and which would fulfill a required prophesy before the End of Days.
5. Before building the temple, a red heifer must be sacrificed in a ritual to cleanse the location.
6. A man named Byron has sent 5 red heifers from Texas to Israel in 2023 for the sacrifice.
7. The sacrifice is the last big step before building the temple and the temple will be for all nations, as the Scripture prescribes.
8. The sacrifice must also take place on passover which is coming up April 22 through April 30.

[This youtube video](https://youtu.be/Je-E69MVgNQ) tells most of the story and some cool details.  History is in the making.

## 03.22 To Plant a Tree

From the Greeks: "A society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shade they shall never sit."

I'd like to add to this.  Some trees can offer unparalleled amounts of shade and these often are ones that cannot be established in a lifetime.  The effort of planting these trees can be painstaking enough to deterr willing hearts. Some rare individuals can see the value of such trees and muster the effort to plant them.

As I ponder this shade analogy it closely relates to certain efforts of mine.  I have a number of goals for which the investment is high and the payout is far into the future.  There is a very special "knowing" feeling about certain projects and my inner compass says they _must be carried out_ regardless of external support.  It's a knowing that there is a future need for shade, that there are no farmers currently planting these specific trees, and a knowing that there exists no alternative for this type of tree. Because of the future impact is so clear and so irreversible, it's a plan I clutch tightly and cannot let go of. These missions can be painful as I go year after year networking and unable to find colleagues who can see the target and the immense value of the efforts to strike it.

The above quote also relates to another, by philosopher Arthur Scopenhauer.  "Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see."

Instead of making claims about being a genius, I want to pivot this thought a little.  Each of us have a combination of life experiences that is completely unique, and that can bring about ideas that are completely unique.  So for anyone who tries, it is certainly possible to envision a solution to a problem which others cannot see.  Further, it's possible to gain sight of a root cause that others cannot see.  In my experience, the solutions are immediate and vivid when a root cause is understood.  The journey to discover a root cause is the difficult part of "seeing the target."

When I meet someone who is even patient and curious enough to ask questions about the missions I'm on, this is the best support I can ask for.  Not someone to solve my problem.  Not to help me build the solution.  Not to understand the problem.  Only, to have the patience and trust to give the time of day to ask what I'm aiming for, hold a discussion, and have some desire to understand.

## 03.18 Repetition grants Perturbations to a Process
Perturbations are prerequisite to define the nature of a need.  A clear need is required to make a good process.  A good process is required to have a robust result.  A robust result is required for stability.  Stability is required for growth.  Growth is required to develop a surplus of resources.  A surplus of resources is the only way to meet a greater need.   Capability and surplus are both required to serve others.

## 02.17 Disintegrated Lifestyle

This is a highly interwoven topic and it may require revisiting in order to express it properly.  Consider this a draft.

The modern American lifestyle is not integrated.  It is dis-integrated. The adoption of tractors, the specialization of job functions, the suburban neighborhood, these are all part of the story of disintegration from the beginning of society.  However, our nature demands integration and we are burning ourselves out in attempt to re-combine it.

Perhaps I can list some questions... I really have no idea how to organize all these thoughts.  Among posts in this blog, please forgive that this one will be chaotic and rather incomplete. 
What did the tractor do?  It reduced the number of farmers from 1000 to 1, per town.  999 people no longer farm.  Now we have 1 man operating a farm, 99 people managing home gardens, and 900 people missing out altogether.  The touch of the hand to the soil transfers seasonally adapted, regionally adapted microbes to the human throughout the year.  Without this, what did we do to reconstruct the natural benefits?  Now we have probiotics.  Thousands of varieties of probiotics developed and sold, and the consumer dispatches their economic prosperity back into the system to collect and consume probiotics in pill form.  When my health was suffering through 2020-2022 I had spent nearly $1,000 on probiotics to attempt to heal my gut.  And the microbes are a tiny sample of what we exclude by detaching from nature. Sunlight, fresh air, wisdom of wildlife, satisfaction of problem solving, excercise... the list goes on and on.

The gym deserves a whole paragraph.  An alien onlooker at our planet would be absolutely dumbfounded. Alien A: "why are the humans so large?"  AlienB: "they have to fight gravity for their whole lives. Every life-form on earth battles gravity, and the ability to exert force is done by muscles and the only way that a human can survive.  Better muscles make a human more effective." The muscle:  the only part of a human that moves.  Blood does not even flow without a muscles. The only thing that separates a human from a computer.  The thing that built society. The most "advanced" civilization eliminated the need for muscles from 95% of job functions.  In terms of the body we rendered adults no more effective than children; men no more effective than women; a fit person no more effective than an unfit person. We used to perform our muscle-building while working, but now we have allocated a special place where you can build your muscles.  One hour per day, one place per city, one motion instead of all motions.  The tractor and similar machinery eliminated physical work, we eliminated most of the motivation to keep our bodies fit, and then we made celebrities out of people who gain enough wealth from their jobs to spend cash on a personal trainer, a gym membership, "rock climbing gear, home-gym gear, fitness apps" and strange refined supplements.  The fitness industry, alone, puts to shame the amount of economic productivity created by the tractor.

Then there are a dozen more chapters we could dive into which spell out the cost of our farming practices - look up the "dead zone" in the gulf of mexico, a byproduct of our nutrient runoff.  Watch the video called "kiss the ground" that spells out the cost of our deteriorated ecosystems that ultimately will employ thousands of disintegrated specialists in attempts to reproduce.  Engineers, biologists, developers of satellites - all of them will join in the efforts to discover and undo the cascading problems we created with simpler, earlier inventions like the tractor.

A "sport" by definition is just a disintegrated part of human society.  Horseshoes is a good example because it's easily traceable to it's integrated origins.  Performing the real work of maintaining our horses was an integration of fun, competitiveness, heavy lifting (they are heavy after 25 horses), practice in dexterity, and when that happens we are naturally drawn to it.  Now weightlifting is a sport, but it used to be a job.  Now sweating is a function for special activities, and it used to be part of life.  We literally have companies that build enclosures that become hot so that we can climb inside and sweat out toxins and enhance our health.  It is called a sauna. But in "undeveloped" societies they sweat for free.  How could we think we could eliminate perspiration - a function that discards more fluids than urination - and still remain healthy? 

Hospitals:  In America, a hospital is a place for specialized people to fix you at very high rates of pay, to repair a body that fell victim to a dis-integrated lifestyle.  Obesity.  Heart disease.  Gut problems.  It must be the potato chips. It must be the cholesterol in the yolk of the egg.  It must be the stress from your toxic family.  We are so unbelievably far from operating in alignment with our human nature that we can only form solutions in the context of a disintegrated society. We cannot fathom the holistic torture we have subjected ourselves to and the result is that our most brilliant experts can only offer dis-integrated solutions like a pharmacuetical product to stack on top of our shopping cart of misguided life choices.

What did the suburban neighborhood do?  We dissected the land (which in truth is owned by nobody) and allocated about 3% of the land for parks where children can play.  A reduction from about 97% in comparison from pre-settlement era where the natural world surrounded us and children could play in 97% of the land.  Wildlife encounters are reduced by probably 99%.  The missouri state flag features a bear - native to the forests that cover 99% of pre-settlement Missouri.  An encounter with a bear can be a life-altering moment.  I've never seen one.  No, wait!  I've seen them at the zoo - a specialized place where we pay money and sign up to have a natural human experience.

I need to pause this topic because the mind is spooling and I didn't even reach the remarks for which I sat down to write.  All of the above is just context to be able to make remarks about some of the encounters I had this week, desperately wishing I could describe to my fellow humans why I'm so inclined towards certain activities and dreading other activities that are generally thought to be good fun for everyone.  It is taxing to participate in a system that you know is not good for you.

Side note: How can I be so attached to natural life and simultaneously dedicate myself to a robotics company? All I can say is that I took a long journey from the caboose of this economic train to the very front of it, and that is what it took to see the whole American story. And it will require credibility of understanding the most advanced technologies combined with the compassion of understanding the value of our elemental human relationship with the planet, to make a useful impact.  If you juxtapose Davinci's works you'll find the same thing: unending fascination with the human biology and simultaneously, an insatiable urge to build, invent, and create technological things.  I don't understand myself but at least I am not alone.

## 02.09 My Culture

I am not an easy person to understand, if one makes assumptions.  I am easy to understand if you speak with me directly and keep an open mind.  Altogether, it is a matter of culture.

It's a bit troubling that our society is riddled with assumptions, but we have to accept that assumptions will take place in order to move forward each day.  Those who care will take time to understand and those who don't understand get to decide if they'll take the time.   My culture is not my parents' culture.  It's not a Missouri template nor American template; it only conforms to those by a tiny fraction. The other elements come from places I have lived, people I lived with, and brand new habits that I have made on my own.   It's a blend of blue collar work ethic, white collar planning, love for nature passed on by native americans and through my boy scout days.  It's blended with Japanese respect for standardization and hive-mindedness, and Brazilian carefree spirit, Mexican appreciation of family.  It's a blend of Muslim reverence for fasting & self-discipline, Christian love-centeredness, Bhuddist appreciation of serenity, and Hindu respect for all life forms.  HOWEVER: my values have changed very little and this is what gives centeredness.  The pieces of culture that I have adopted from my broad environments are simply methods and behaviors that align with my long-standing values.   

Is someone allowed to make their own culture?  Yes, in fact it's almost necessary these days since the internet was recently invented and the world changed far more rapidly than a generation could adapt to.  Whereas we normally adopt the culture of our previous generation, this is no longer relevant.  One could not survive with their parents' behavior in their teens and twenties even if such a behavior drove your parents to thrive.  So, adapt or die as they say.  And certainly we have adapted but usually without a role model, since the present is unlike the past.  In this new era of each generation and geographic space developing new cultural aspects from scratch, we are forced to follow some type of new example or we can make our own decisions at every moment, or simply fail to change and become victims of constant misunderstanding.

If all the nations were held constant, even Millenials' culture differs more drastically from Baby Boomers in the USA than most countries differ from one another at any given year.  Texas has changed rapidly and in a different direction than the East Coast, Missouri, etc, so the geographical locale of your childhood, teens, and early professional years certainly does not match the impact of the changes which took place in another region. And since Covid 19, each culture around the world made drastic adjustments in "what is expected of your fellow people" in a given situation, in only a few years' time.  

One CANNOT assume things about my behaviors or my words, unless we've understood each other at that very moment.  I have never met someone like me by age 30.  My life experience is too strange and too varied.  It's not possible.  But if we offer each other the respect that one gives to a total stranger from a foreign land, and we put a strong effort to set aside assumptions, there can be a beautiful exchange.  I work extremely hard to provide context for my words and to accomodate each person's personal background in styling my communication but I can only do my best.

I feel I'm a canvas that borrows elements from amazing people and experiences around the world, a great deal of suffering and a great deal of moments of synchrony with others.  There is so much that I can share with someone who has an open mind.  A truly open mind means that you cannot interpret my behavior using the context of your own culture.  Trust me, our culture is not the same.  Have you grown up poor?  Have you worked in the design center of a multinational corporation?  Have you married a brazilian woman?  Have you learned another language?  Have you learned another alphabet?  Have you spent hundreds of nights in the forest? Have you bought land, or raised chickens? Or rented an apartment in a dangerous town? Have you had an emergency surgery without any insurance? Have you ever invested in public stocks?  Have you ever filmed a movie? If not, you aren't familiar with my context.  I won't ask that you attempt to learn my context, as that is too much burden.  I ask that you remove all labels from me, do not ascribe characteristics I have not demonstrated, and do not dare to try to interpret one of my past actions or words in the context of my current life. I never had even three years in my life that my surrounding conditions were at a constant.  So, even attempting to converge your ideas about me from one year to another year would be a mistake, and likely a harmful one.  And while you're at it, deliver that same freedom to the other people in your life who you meet.  You will be amazed at how much more love and acceptance can flow in all directions.

As I consider this more, it may be one of the most essential two wishes I could make for our modern people.  One is that we could eliminate assumptions and start fresh with those who are familiar and unfamiliar.  And another is that we could allow ourselves the freedom to detach from our customs and make our decisions based on our values, as they apply to our very precise situations at hand, and with the people we encounter.  So much anxiety and isolation could be relieved in our world.  Please consider it deeply.

## 01.29  If there's a God and he's Good

Today a trail of thoughts brought me to a comical idea and I think it contains a lesson so I'm sharing it here.

Here's a thought exercise that can help you through one of society's Big Doubts.  If there is a God and he is 100% Good, how could he possibly allow for so many bad things to happen, and for bad people to be all around us?  Call to mind your favorite movie of all time, by your favorite director of all time.  Hopefully you're intensely pleased by seeing the movie, even if it made you feel afraid or shocked or upset in some moments.  Overall by your own judgement, it's a good one.   Let's imagine that life is your movie.  I'll use the Lion King for analogy just because it's quite famous.  Now, think of the worst person or the worst mistake that was made in your movie.  It hurt feelings, it caused suffering, etc.  Next, remove the villain or the bad stuff and think about the movie.  Does the movie still have meaning?  If we removed uncle Scar from the lion king, I don't think it would ever be very famous.  In this new version, Mufasa doesn't die, no threat is overcome, etc.  Ok, so we probably can agree the whole story loses it's impact and the movie no longer ranks as a great movie.  Perhaps you disagree, and you'd love the new version that has no evil.  Well, you're not the author or the director are you?  Imagine writing a letter to the director of the Lion King and requesting that the evil lions and harmful events are all removed. You can dispute the author, but it would be nothing more than a display of arrogance and lack of insight. If you think the writer added the villains on accident then WOW that would leave huge room for improvement and you'd be the famous writer or the famous director, wouldn't you? How many books of Harry Potter would sell without Captain Snape?  It's laughable to imagine.  And nobody ever made an impactful story without suffering.  Without loss there is no recovery, without a battle there is no victor, etc.  If you could imagine life is just one big story, the story without conflict makes very little sense.  And even if it makes perfect sense to you, then feel free to dispute someone about it. Each evil contains a lesson, a bystander who grows, a wrong made right, and it is the change which is so much more important than the event.

## 01.25 How to Help Society

*How to lend a hand to the lower classes of society* - A brief guide.

1) TRUSTING ► First, you'll have to earn their trust.  If you have the power to help them, you'll look like other powerful people, and they won't trust you.  This is the first mountain to climb.
2) BELIEVING ► Then, you'll have to make them believe a result is possible.  One result, that they never saw in their lifetime.  It does not matter how big or how small but it must be a real tangible result.  Photographs, schematics, stories, and literature does not work.  You must take real action, in person, in their community.  There will need to be a result (A poor town in guatemala, a group of young learners in an educated society, a team of women engineering in a STEM field, non-english speakers in an english-dominated world... whatever it may be).
3) UNDERSTANDING ► Then, you'll have to advise at least one person, who reaches a full understanding.  The person must reach such a proficiency such that they can reproduce a result, furthermore teach a peer, and furthermore verify the results of the peer.
4) SELLING ► Next, you must help them believe that the change is worthwhile.  Clean water pipes require maintenance.  Electric pumps require utility payments. Everything has a cost and they know the cost much better than they know the reward.  They must be sufficiently onboard that you can hear the words back from the community: "we want this thing and we are sure."
5) SWEATING ► Next, they need a chance to change their mind.  The costs must precede the results. We call this sweat equity.  you tell them "you're not paying for these results in cash but you are paying in effort."  Tasks must be actioned by the community and led by the community leaders, and you must resist the urge to "just pay for a new one" or do the work for them, no matter how much your experience would ease the process.
6) STAYING ►  Then, you must stay for support.  Forever.  There will be turnover of leaders.  There will be gaps in knowledge.  There will be obstacles arriving from the periphery.  The beneficiaries of the results, will have their lives changed and you can be sure they will leave the community, rise up and prosper in another place. After all, if you fund someone's college degree and they graduate, they usually don't stay around to teach the next student.  Staying can be done in two ways.  The minimal saying is to remain on-call for the rest of your life.  If you're unreachable, expect that the step 1 will unravel and you must begin again. The alternative to being on-call is to convince one of the exiteers to return and stay.  That job is not easy and not common.
6.1) The steps become a cycle and the only way for continuous growth is by continuous implementation.  Each new student must learn to trust.  Each new generation must start at the receiving end of step 1, because even with all the results acting perfectly in their favor, their doubts will beg the question "how can I be sure it was done the best way, or for the right reasons, or that anyone was looking out for me?"

As I wrote, I realized it has nothing to do with lower classes of society.  It's a cycle for helping anyone gain assets that are longer lasting than some spending money. I have seen & participated in these activities that follow the model, as examples:
* Building access to clean water for a community.
* Teaching a young boy scout new skills.
* Parents passing their values on to children.
* College undergraduates taking on a new challenge.
* International researchers attending university in the USA & attemping to steer towards career success.

At any time I've tried to help someone and failed, and most times that I hear helpers losing hope, the broken result always comes from somewhere in that cycle.  And in the same way, I have never seen a result last more than one generation without each of the steps implemented.

## 01.18 Ranking pain

I've had the following experiences and I'll rank them in pain, in case anyone would like to know.  (It's more fun to read them from 7 to 1, where 7 is the least painful).

1) being served divorce papers, and then being served divorce papers a second time, and only learning that the first divorce request had been terminated on the same day that the second set of papers were served.
2) returning from overseas to discover my home was wrecked by tenants and the contracted property managers were defending the tenants rights to destroy property without intervention.
3) contracting e-coli, losing all strength, spending 50% of my days bedridden for 100 days, developing a fear of most foods, discovering McDonalds' Big Mac can be digested and passed safely, having relief via antibiotics, having the pathogen return, fearing all water sources to be potentially contaminated, losing 25lbs starting from a lean 9% bodyfat (going into non-measurable territory), losing all faith in doctors, and subsequently following my father's recommendation to fast and follow that with Jack Daniels' Gentleman Jack, to kill the pathogen, and finally, take two years to recover, for a period requiring abstinence from my favorite hot sauces.  Then, having lost tolerance for hot sauces, attending dinner at my friends home and getting called out for my wimpy spice tolerance.
4) winding up 5 miles away from a source of water in a Utah desert mountain bike trail, in full sun without shade, in the summer, with a friend suffering from heat exhaustion who was unable to mount his bike, and walking alongside him back to safety. No cell phones or emergency signaling equipment.
5) getting struck by a car and breaking the wrist, lacerations on the back and arm.
6) losing electricity in my texas home on the hottest day of the summer and performing an 8 hour repair without help, in the midday sun through sunset, calling a dozen people for help and finding they were too busy, until at a certain point the sun was low enough to cast a shadow on the west side of the home where the electric box was located.
7) observing a bully in grade 6 harassing one of my friends, defending the friend, and becoming a co-victim of the bully team which expanded to include the bully's friends, and becoming outcast in a class of only 25 students for the subsequent 3 years.

## 01.11 Caring for a creative mind.

This message is for everyone who is a creative person or who loves a creative person.  Since the word creative is somewhat ambiguous, let's use the following description for the purpose of this entry.

A creative person is everyone who makes thousands of decisions per day. A creative worker is one who makes thousands of decisions to output a bit of work.  For a painter, every brushstroke. As I write this post, each and every word is a decison.  My work is subjected to a state of flow and cannot materialize the work unless the mind is flowing.

I spoke with my older sister yesterday, and I was blasted with 3 or 4 remarks circling a mindset of ♠ let's be realists, not optimists ♠ it's unhealthy to avoid negativity ♠ you're a fool if you are always positive ♠.  So, after about a dozen times in the past few months of hearing my loved ones fight for their rights to negativity & darkness, let me share something that can clarify where negativity belongs and where it doesn't.

#### Part1: I'm not anti-negative, I'm pro-positive. 
With all else equal, I lean 1% positive so I take control of the default thought pathway. If you spend time with a therapist you'll see value in this.  

#### Part2: Negativity infects and destroys creativity.
Jennifer, like myself, is a very creative worker.  If you eliminated her decisions for the day, you'd discover the day is devoid of the productivity she desires. Unlike an assembly-line worker, her production is not supported by prompts and processes, so she would produce no output that day; no progress.  Her work  (Jen, if you're reading this you can add that to your list of who you are; you're a creative person, indisputably. Elle, if you're reading this, it is an example of how I can know something about you that you don't know about yourself.  There are infinite perspectives and you, by definition, only carry one.) A perspective derived from a multitude of strange and unrelated activities, can possibly circumscribe you better than your own perspective, if things are left up to chance. 

So, creativity by my definition is a sequence of decisions that move someone towards a goal, and since the goal was not defined by anyone except the self, it's promptless, highly internal, and VERY subject to inputs.  Creativity is fragile because we are designed to process many inputs, as humans.(imagine, the human spends the first two decades learning to simultaneously process all five senses, plus past knowledge, plus the tuned-functions such as the foot balance of a skateboarder.)  Then if we establish a creative work tasking for ourselves, we must turn OFF every single input and stop processing those, so that we are in a state of output. The state of flow is the state where your mind post-processes huge amounts of inputs from the past and *flows* the byproducts back out of you - through literature, art, designs, ideas, music, or any innovation whatsoever.  I personally believe that adding banana-chips to my ice cream last night was just one creative decision while my more important work is compilations of thousands.  The creative part is the unprompted part.

If your work depends on thousands of decisions per hour🤞, then it depends on creativity, and then it depends on flow, and then it depends on proper treatment of the mind.  In 2022 I recovered my mental health from a divorce and in 2023 I made immense changes to my own self-treatment so that my outputs can become productive and fulfilling on a brand new level.  The results are immense, with each day on average giving me at least 90 minutes of intense flow that is joyful, satisfying, and passionate.  Never in my life have I discovered so much passion and effortless pleasure in the work I do. I live for those 90 minutes. And, it takes at least 22 hours of self care to make it happen.  

Since we cannot control the mind, we should carefully control the inputs to it 🤞🤞. If I am not careful about negative thoughts; not careful about the timing, placement, conditions, and trails behind each of those thoughts, then I can wreck my 90 minutes, and then wreck a whole day.  If I wreck a whole day, and stumble on worry, I can wreck a whole week.  If I wreck a whole week, and my physical healthcare falters, I can wreck a whole season.  If I am in a bad mood and I choose the wrong words with a colleague, I can wreck a whole project. If humans were not so good at wrecking things, everyone would produce a masterpiece once per year, AT THE LEAST!

So, to my loved ones: please treat me with gentleness if I am blocking negativity at a particular moment, because negativity is powerful. Please don't fault me for managing my own mindset in my own way.  Negativity is like a tax, we have to pay it but we can budget that stuff in a way that works for us individually.

🤞 Let us credit ourselves with each decision, down to the smallest. Even if you are an elementary school teacher developing a worksheet for your kids, you are performing creative work.  The only way it isn't creative is if the worksheet is a reproduction, if the template is pre-chosen, if the font is pre-decided, if the kids in class don't cross have no impact on your worksheet, etc.  Everything you put down in the work is a unique fusion of your experiences and the inspiration derived from you as a person.

🤞🤞 According to Sadhguru [we cannot control the mind.](https://youtube.com/shorts/Mlnds-Zbyak)



## 01.10 The Worst Kind of Adultery.

I had years to think about this.  My marriage was deteriorating long before she left the home.

I had quit my job and moved overseas to join her in the pursuit of establishing her career, after I helped her with her PhD.

During the PhD, her professor received commitment and sacrifice that should have been given to me. 
During the job, her team received commitment, love, and sacrifice that should have been given to me.

I recall the toxic situation where the professor created a deadline out of nothing, an arbitrary decision by him, requiring her to finish a dataset over a weekend where we had intended to spend time together, while we were engaged.
First she cancelled her plans with me, and committed her weekend to fulfill something for the professor.  Then, I learned that there was no consequence if the deadline were missed.  There was no course grade, there was to be no missed submission of a paper to a journal committee, there was literally no actual gain for her to commit to the professor what belonged to me?  I mulled over it.  There was no reward for her to meet such a deadline.  There was only a punishment of "he will be mad at me" if she did not fulfill the commitment.  So, she chose to make her fiance mad instead of make her professor mad.  On her last birthday, who had given up time to do something special for her?  Not the professor.  Just the fiance.  

So, of course I did not review my own rights in the relationship carefully enough to realize I was being cheated.  Instead I felt her worry, I committed time to accelerate her progress, making lunch and taking care of administrative items in the home so that she could finish more quickly and then perhaps spend the sunday with me.  But, she struck a few barriers and we lost the sunday as well.  She gave.  I gave.  Nobody gained.  A few years later, she was married to me and she had zero interaction with this professor.  The relationship was built on fear and worry, and the benefits of her sacrifice vanished. Nobody won.

Since I still did not learn, I continued this type of behavior after her graduation.  The trouble was that I was confident I could support my career, my life, my relationships, and offer her enough support that her overbearing and unrewarding work environment would ease, and finally we would reach the reward of quality time together, enjoyment of meals together, and a stronger committment in each hour of each day.  This did not happen.  By having my support at home, and continuing to feel the threat from her superiors at work that she was insufficient (again with no legitimate targets, no rewards for milestones, simply fear and punishment delivered for anything shy of perfection.  And if her team had great results one month, this would bump the arbitrary and insubstantiated goals for the next month up to a matching level.  The more support I gave, the more fuel she had to push her career, and thousands of minutes that belonged on family were devoted from her mind into the easing of her career pains.  It was as if "David will always find more patience, find more ways to feel OK, and develop clever methods to ease life for both partners." 

As the marriage crumbled later, I saw that my patience was based on my trust that I was building something. I was building something immense.  The best marriage that ever could exist.  Without any guarantees or paperwork, I devoted my love to her relief, and she in turn devoted her time to career. Good! This would translate to trust and appreciation, which would be the foundation of a wonderful partnership, and then the start of an amazing family.  She would feel secure with her goals, she would feel secure with her husband, and she would be a superstar of a researcher and a superstar wife, to become a superstar mother.  I built her up.

She had made a promise that 5pm was the dropdead cutoff and every weekend was 100% mine, if I move overseas with her. This promise was broken and pulverized.

The painful thing is that if she had cheated on me with a man, at least the man would have been offering her something. Usually it consists of compliments, quality time, gifts, plenty of things that fulfill basic human needs, so the woman cheating would go home and feel at least more confidence and more as if her cup was filled.  This was much worse.  Of course she did her makeup and hair and dressed up with careful planning for the career.  Of course I lost that.  It was so bad that she came home in a daze several times that I had grilled an amazing salmon dinner and she walked right past it and went to open her laptop.  Then the part I can't get over.  The part that took longest for me to understand.  She gave away her communication.  She came home failing to speak sentences in cohesive english.  She could offer dozens of excuses such as english was her second language - but she had a PhD which was earned in English.  She had articulated advanced and commendable liturature and given speeches at podiums that people understood perfectly well. She knew Brazilian English, American English, and British English.  She wrote emails daily that were easy to understand.  When it was all given away, she didn't even have the mental capacity to offer me basic communication.  And since she was all I had in that country, I examined her speech patterns and learned to understand Portuguese, Lazy English, and Proper English.  I studied a language so I could have from my wife the things most people get from a girlfriend on the first day.

I was cheated on, comprehensively, for the entire duration of my marriage.  Sex is not the most important thing in marriage.  The offering she gave outside the marriage was vastly bigger, vastly uglier, and more destructive.

And I still love her.  I love her like a daughter, because I know she took so much from me but love is forever and I know what I gave her was the only way for her to have enough comfort to make it as far as she did, and the world will benefit from a person who advanced as far as she, as early as she.  I'm proud of her.  She is not fit to be the mother of my children and I'll never ask for that, but she's certainly fit to help the world and I'm happy that I supported that more than any husband I've ever heard of.

Take care, everyone.


## 01.08 I don't do things quickly.

I don't do things that take less than 2 years.

* If you see me finish a 1-day project, I was preparing for years before that.
* If you see me start a 1-day project, it's just an action in a long-term project.

I cooked an egg on a new skillet.  But that's not what I was concerned with. I was evaluating the heat flow of a cast iron unit with smaller mass.
Before that, I tested the larger skillet.
6 years before that, I tried to cook an egg like I got at a restaurant.
4 years before that, I studied heat capacity & thermal conductivity.
4 years before that, I learned about the denaturing process of eggs, which turns the protein white.
5 years before that, I was cooking eggs over a campfire in boy scouts.
a few years before that, I learned that eggs are good for your health.
Between all of those things, I was asking hundreds of questions and exploring the answers.  I even raised chickens and cooked the eggs in the process.

It becomes hard to explain my behaviors to people.  The alternative to all of this is when I get caught up in something and take action without learning.  If you see this, then I'm making a mistake.  Kindly let me know.

## 01.07 What nobody told you about Last Names:

I've heard several arguments from my generation (millenials) that it's an outdated and pointless practice for a woman to take a man's last name upon marriage.  I have never heard the following discussion points so I am sharing them below.  Everyone is free to choose their own path, and I don't believe in tradition for the sake of tradition, so instead I think it's worthwhile to take note of why women, for many ages, changed their last name when they marry a husband.

One purpose is to guarantee support for the woman.  Throughout civilization, it has always been a problem that some men have left a woman as a single mother, and some men have concieved children in all sorts of places around the world outside of their home.  There's no society that enjoys those sad situations.  The woman naturally has a stronger bond to the children than the man, and it's almost impossible for a mom to willingly abandon a child (even if the child costs her health, her money, or consumes all of her basic needs such that she is at risk).  A mom's heart is very big, I suppose.  Sometimes the law can help, sometimes several factors can help, but many times it turns out tragically.  The woman who takes a man's last name then appears in society for the rest of her life as the person who was taken care of by the man with such a last name, and if the man runs away from his responsibility in fatherhood, the woman and the child bearing his name give a signal to society that he was the one who is responsible for the family, wherever he may be found. The husband is the one who owes caretaking for the family, and if the dad is missing for some period he will still be linked for his whole life to that responsibility and it develops a long term pressure from society for the man to stay there and support the family.  Nobody wants to grow up without a father. For the man to give his last name to his family, that is a major form of commitment.

If divorce happens, and if the woman remarries and changes her name again, the most common case is that the children born to a "smith" man retains his last name, and retains society's pressure for "child support" which is vastly wider than just a paycheck.  The modern laws governing paychecks for child support is truly a meager thread of a portion of the true meaning of supporting a child.  I don't think anyone would argue that cash is a better father than a real father.

There is further support built into society in the name-sharing just in regards to fidelity.  If a man goes to meet a mistress in his city, it's very easy for word to get around that he belongs back at the home with the woman who shares his name.  The fact that traceability is embedded into the literal name of the person is stronger than that which any laws can enforce.  We all desire fidelity but there's no police or priest who is willing to follow a man around and if he's "working late" it's far easier to discover the truth in a little bit of time.

The circle of friends post-marriage generally know both the man and the wife, and they are a social pressure for the couple to work out problems they have instead of watching the man slip into an affair, or other bad outcomes. Then that means, if the man wants to have an affair he has to go FAR outside of the shared family and friends, and it takes an investment of time to even make this happen. Cash, travel, etc must be spent, making the adulterer more obvious and less tolerable, sooner. He carries on his conscience the fact that his earnings are spent on an unnecessary travel, instead of on the needs of the rest of the Smiths.  You can guarantee this puts a heavy weight on the person to do right instead of wrong. 

On a similar note, people wore wedding rings so to signal to the world that "this woman is taken" and "this man is taken."  It was all pretty cohesive before we had cheap easy flights out of town, more frequent moving across borders, and more of our social action taking place on the internet.  When grown men go looking for someone else to love, they often wind up meeting an old friend from younger years.  I personally missed out on my 10 year high school reunion, and during that month I tried to look up some of my friends (both genders) and the women who were married were nearly impossible to find.  So, in the case that I wanted to get in touch with a lady friend from the past, she becomes quite unavailable for reconnecting after she changes her name.  I think this is pretty awesome.  It means for the husband, he receives a thick layer of those-other-men-can't-find-my-wife-anymore and it has a two-part enhancement for me.  Firstly, I feel more secure that she isn't as reachable by other prowling single men, and secondly, it enhances the responsibility I feel for her.  I've got to take care of my wife physically and emotionally because she's relying on me and she truncated much of her other options.

There are lots of worst-case situations that are fended off with last names and engagement rings. There's a specially infamous one (listen to any pre-2000 music) where a woman has a child from another man.  Once again, the diamond ring is the fiance's commitment.  If she gets pregnant before the wedding, by another man, then the soon-to-be husband has to weigh heavy decisions.  One option is to walk away and let her sell the diamond to pay for diapers, one option is to stay together because she's too expensive to lose.  And in a way, this decision is made by buying that ring.  The man is making a fat commitment.  So after they are engaged, then the man is going to intensively commit his social time for the woman, because nights out with the guys mean the woman has nights out wherever she may go.  Those are all just opportunities for things to go wrong.  So, the man had all his life before engagement to go out with his guy friends, and now it's a transition to invest more time in building that relationship before the wedding day.

Some of this may sound archaic but most of the other countries in the world outside of the USA have a heavy dose of pre-y2k lifestyles and it's still very relevant to keep the traditions for the good that they do.  It's troubling when I try to share perspectives from around the whole planet and my discussion is labeled that of a "far-right conservative, outdated, religious zealot," and so on.  I can speak with complete honesty that my thoughts are my own, and my reasons are shared with people around the whole planet, who collectively make up 96% of the world population and a vastly smaller fraction of the influence.  I'll gladly continue to speak truths about these matters and be a voice for the world in a place where that voice barely exists.

By the way, if you google boomers, gen-z, millenials - all of these generations are defined only in the USA - the world does not adopt these.   Think about that for the next few years and you'll be much more balanced in your thoughts.

## 01.05 How to Love a Sibling

We don't always want the same thing.  We don't always speak the same love languages.  We don't have the same needs.  With all of that, the golden rule doesn't always work.  "Treat others how you want to be treated" is a starting point.

1.  Know what you want, so you can feel loved.
2.  Know what your sibling wants, and ask if you don't know.
3.  Focus on today.  If you're talking today, now is the moment to do good.
4.  get to a position that you both want good outcomes.  even if good looks different for each.  That's love.
5.  Remember, there is no problem if you cannot offer the first thing they want.  It's not your job to fulfill the siblings needs - that's their own job.  It's your job to give from the set of loving things you have available to you.  It's also fair if they only want one thing at this moment, you haven't offered it, and they don't wish to interact today.  There is always tomorrow.
6.  Be honest about what you can commit.  Know yourself enough that you can offer something, you can identify your offering, you can put into words what you identified, and then share your words.
7.  Follow through.
8.  If you mess it up, improve something.  Actionably.


## 01.02 Can you handle the TRUTH?

True fact: good decisions should be celebrated. Can you handle it?

My parents divorced when I was a teenager, right after moving out to college.  With the world filled with arbitrary compasses, misguidance and greed, the parent's job is to lead the ones they love, just as any leader must lead with their heart aligned with their actions.

This is what we have all gotten wrong:  When someone makes a heart-wrenching decisions such as to split up a family, they must only do it if they truly feel it is the right thing to do.  Then if it's right, it should be celebrated.  With the younglings looking up to the parents amidst a life-altering year, the only way for them to feel comfort while many discomforts happen, is if the parents are following truth and can offer that truth to the ones who are confused, worried, and suffering.

Sometimes divorce is the right decision, I do not think this is disputed.  But certainly it's uncommon to consider it celebration-worthy. I want to compare it to getting admitted to a college degree program, wherein our young students often celebrate with their families.

The decision consists of:
* A future with far less time together with family
* A long-term commitment that is irreversible; or only reversible at extremely high cost
* A sacrifice of at least 4 years of salary, for the student-to-be.  A high sacrifice.
* The cost of relocation, purchasing copies of previously shared home goods, and many more costs such as divided utility bills.
* The loneliness and personal challenge that the person must exit their comfort zone and meet new friends.
* Intensive reworking of the schedule and patterns of the individual, requiring each family member to reinvent their methods of interaction and exchanging love if they want to remain connected.
* A complete letting go of the "what-if" situations that lie on the other side of the big change.
* Setting a vast number of previously established needs to be met by unknown new circumstances.

Ok, so the bullet points above are descriptions for both a college admission and for a divorce.  Precisely equal. Why do we only celebrate one, and avoid talking about the other?  They both can inflict pain, depending on the perspective.  Immense pain.  It is the responsibility of the DECISION-MAKER to clarify to their loved ones why the decision will ultimately benefit everyone, and to transmit the positive version of the future outlook. What if I told you the only way for the young ones to even have an inkling of a chance to see the positive perspective of a divorce, is if they receive intensive clarity and joyful discussion of how everyone will win in the long run?  What if I told you this is a discussion that cannot be faked?  Kids may be ignorant but they have a very powerful ability to sense what is in the heart of a person who approaches them with a message.  So if you can't fake it, and you know it's the right choice, and you love them enough to help them out of the suffering, there is only one option.  Do what is right or take that path that makes everyone suffer.

And if you failed, it's never too late to celebrate.  Hearts can ache for a long long time.

## 01.02 The Angel and the Bear and the Witch and the Priest

What an incredible new years eve weekend.  The experiences I'm facing daily are too incredible not to share and too interwoven to describe as quickly as they're happening.  

On new years eve weekend (Saturday the 30th through Sunday the 1st) I met a diverse and fascinating number of people.  There was an Angel, a bear, a witch, a priest, a Korean man from Austin peddling Japanese plants, a Japanese girl who moved to America, a young college man needing advice in career, a Venezuelan single mother who immigrated illegally without breaking the law, a Mexican-American couple, Two native Americans descended from the Spanish Missions.... I might not remember all of them.  Oh a business investor who hates his job, a beautiful African-american woman with a dazzling new-years dress, and a homeless man who informed me of his intentions to "fix" the puddle in the parking lot of a seafood restaurant, who claimed to work at the restaurant but I think he is not on their payroll.  How kind of him.

Just so that you know I'm not crazy, the aforementioned titles are self-declared by the individual people; this is not a description I'm making up.  If a native american tells me that he is partly a bear and partly a wolf, and wholly a human - who am I to negate the description?  I'm not being facetious or sarcastic. Scout's honor!  So now that i've written the introduction I am realizing it's going to be impossible for me to write more than a small fraction of the stories.  Here is one highlight: 

I learned what is special about the Mona Lisa for the first time in my life.  When I visited the church called the Grotto (same place where I met the priest), I saw first-hand a painting that shared a feature of the mona lisa.  The special feature is that the eyes of the subject are depicted so accurately in her gaze, that the painting begins to feel like the subject is looking at you.  It is similar to a photograph wherein the subject is looking directly at the camera lens. It has nothing to do with how perfectly the skin and features are made by the paintbrush, it is entirely a matter of the eyes. As humans, we are able to detect if someone is looking into our eyes, down to a fraction of a degree in orientation.  You can sometimes even detect if the person is looking at you, or 10 meters past you. This means we are instantaneously computing the vectors of both right and left eye of the person gazing at us, in a fraction of a second, and without even thinking.  From my studies in engineering, I could describe this mathematically and it essentially consists of a pointed vector (eyeball of subject) being directed in 3D space towards a specific object (the lens, or the eyes of the audience who looks at the camera, or finally, the audience who looks at the printout/painting when they are in the same room). 

This is marvelous because it explains why people say "it feels like Mona Lisa is staring at you, even when you walk across the room." and it is true, because the painting has affixed the gaze into the "lens" so it is permanently positioned in a way that you can notice this focal alignment.  Below I'll show photos of the grotto, the painting of jesus "looking at you," and the mona lisa.  I think it's pretty special that to see how remarkable the painting is, you actually have to have a physical printout of it, at a decent scale.  It doesn't work so well when you look at a photo of the photo on your phone.    I also think it's special that DaVinci was very much a mechanical engineer, and that mechanical engineers are the only type of engineer who study vectors of light energy as well as the other machine elements that DaVinci created in his work.  (levers, gears, rotational systems, etc).  So now I have a newfound appreciation for the artist/engineer combination, because historically this pairing is not rewarded (and it's therefore rare) and in order to paint a Mona Lisa you need to understand both art and engineering, somewhat.

# December 2023

## 12.26 Hope is on the Rise.

Something has changed.  As things fall in line, certain friends who fell away are returning to reconnect.  There are others who have gone completely silent and their intermittent murmurs are gone. Family members who have paid no attention are beginning to pay attention, and some lukewarm connections who had never anything good to say about my life pursuits have slammed the door shut, wanting nothing to do with me.  It's as if the sea is parting and the elements which are good for me are beginning to swarm, while the elements that were never good for me are being drawn by an invisible force to the distant background.  There was a tiktok that I made this summer about the sadness of having "nobody to prove right and nobody to prove wrong" as I start a company, define my own purpose, and become more authentic.  The evidence that I'm doing nothing noteworthy is becoming more and more scarce, and there is less and less evidence for the haters to cling to.  The ones who still wish to hate are recalculating their arguments, simply attacking my character with no grounds at all, or collecting more farfetched ideas to slip out into the road like banana peels.  Things are good.  And things are getting better.  If you're one of those people who doesn't feel very supported - reach out because I have more than enough encouragement to share.

_Hope: The belief in a positive future coupled with the belief that my actions can impact this future._

Peace and love and Merry Christmas to All.

## 12.25 Modern Mistletoe

Christmas is here today and since I'm in my texas home alone (but not lonely) I get lots of time to think.  I think that a "free hugs" shirt or sign is the modern version of Mistletoe, a christmas-time tradition rarely practiced since year 2000 but still found in Christmas songs across the world.

First, you need to understand the context of a kiss throughout history.  When I spent time in south america, I noticed a multitude of parallels between historical USA and modern Brazil, for example.  It's common to greet with a kiss and a hug.  If I meet a new friend for the very first time, it is common to give a kiss on the cheek if she is a lady and a hug if it is a man.  More business-like interactions are somewhat decoupled from this while family interactions are very plugged into this practice.  I'd argue anyway, that business interactions are the "developed country" flavoring in a "developing country."  So, if you want to know about historical America, look at a less developed nation and it's practices _outside_ of the business context.   In europe as well, where folks are better linked to their roots, you'll find family and friends offering a kiss to one another.

As a young boy I heard about mistletoe and thought that was a tradition that sounded quite promiscuous and sensual whereas the world would barely notice this tradition - it wouldn't stand out at all from the rest of the traditions.  An adult man kissing his sister or his mother is completely normal.  On the other hand, if I picture my two sisters and who they've kissed the most in this year, it is certainly their dogs.  Surely the dog receives dozens of kisses per day.  This love, in older generations, was offered to family and friends. 

What else has changed?  We are becoming less attuned to social cues.  Mistletoe is a subtle detail of a decorated home while a "free hugs" is very in-your-face.  Nowadays, we are so flooded with messages that in order to get someone's attention, one must literally spell it out for you.  That makes me a bit sad.  I wish that I could behave these days with adopted culture from some of the other countries where I've spent time, and with behaviors I feel represent me better as a human, and I'd not be judged poorly by other Americans.  If only I spoke no English, I'd be liberated to behave the way that I want to behave, in positive and loving ways, and not receive any ridicule.  In fact, folks might just open their minds to other ways of living, and an inkling of change might take place.

## 12.19 Who are you? - The Who

Around September I asked my two sisters this question.  Who are you?  What describes you as a person? It's now mid December but I could not yet get an answer.  The question can be difficult but regarding myself I've been working on this for over a year and each time I explore, I discover more.  Quite honestly it makes me appreciate an individual as I discover who they are. 

A great number of our "characteristics" or behaviors are products of a circumstance.  Or, they are products of a stage in life - transient elements that don't hold true for very long.  So, if we acknowledge this, and we also acknowledge how much life has dumped on our plates (problems, must-do's like taxes, or behaviors that are no more than reactions to things we didn't invite into our lives). I think I can help my siblings get started on this question.  

It starts with choosing another person in your family, and asking who are they.  Who is my grandfather, Leo?  With over 20 grandchildren spread across the St. Louis metropolitan area, we didn't spend a lot of time with Rita and Leo but we have these images in our minds of who they are.  Leo had passed away by the time I was 12 so it is safe to say I only know a few things about him.  He had tattoos.  He had a garden with fully grown fruit trees, that got harvested for apples and pears.  He loved animals, and he was the only one I know in his generation who had his own pet bird.  He was in the navy before raising a family.  Now, look at my younger sister.  She loves gardening.  She works with horses, loves animals.  She has a pet bird.  Lots of people have a dog, but I'm sure several people know my sister as the friend with a pet bird.  She did not join the Navy.  I'll claim that's a matter of circumstance, as the navy doesn't recruit many women and we weren't in any naval wars as she grew up. She has tattoos.  Neither of our parents got tattoos.  Neither of our parents had a garden, or a bird.  It feels like in some sense our parents were so involved in our lives it is hard to characterize them simply, while the people on the further periphery of our lives can be identified in brief and simple terms.  For those who are closest to us, we know so much about their circumstances that it's hard to untangle the circumstance from the person. 

If you look at my father, he was an auto-mechanic for several years and he loved the american sports cars from the 60's and 70's.  He never had a sports car from the time I was born, but at this stage all of his resources were directed to raising his four kids.  For almost any person's parents, the person could say "they love A, and B, and C, but they love me more."  So for my case I may never know how much my dad loved engines and cars because those require money, raising kids requires money, and he put his money into raising his kids.  Fast forward into my years of starting to earn an income, and suddenly you see this passion return.  I had a journey of exploring cars with an expanding budget starting with a 98 civic hatchback, then a 96 mazda miata, then a 2002 subaru wrx, then a 2005 chevy corvette.  When I got married, those vanished, same as my father.  Before the civic there was a 93 ford ranger 4x4, which truly was a tool for me to operate my lawn-cutting business but I chose a manual transmission so I could drive it like a sports car.  Then, if you look back to my father's father (Eugene) his whole career was about cars.  He established an auto mechanics shop where several of his sons worked before they started families.  

I know a bit less about my grandmothers. Impulsively I thought perhaps they just weren't into anything, but that isn't true.  They each mothered and raised over 8 kids so that surely required most of their time and effort, and surely their passions were manifested in the kids and in their husbands - I mean naturally a woman who has her own passions will marry a man who either shares the passions or supports some of hers.  I know that my grandmother loved hot air balloons, and took a few trips in hot air balloons.  It's hard to think of any passion that is more symbollic than a hot air balloon ride.  Airplanes were already invented.  Nobody needs a hot air balloon.  How does one characterize this activity if we wish to say it tells something about a person?  You leave the ground, you enter the sky, and you go wherever the wind takes you.  You literally give up all control and begin a guaranteed adventure. You have a chance to look down on the earth - something we can't do in most airplanes.  Margaret must have had a spirit of adventure.  

If I ask about my sisters - what characterizes them and what passions do they have deeply within them?  Adventure is undeniable.  My older sister moved out of the house as early as she could, lived in Chicago, traveled to Europe, visited the Galapagos islands, worked on a salmon boat in alaska, and on a farm in Mexico.  My younger sister has not done these, wants to do these types of things, and is going absolutely mad while finances or other circumstances are getting in the way.   She is an adventurer for certain.  And, if we want to say that raising more kids than you can count on your hands is a tell about an inner caretaker, and to ask if my two sisters carry this caretaking gene, I would declare yes it is true.  For both of them, they don't have a partner to start a family but we could attribute that to circumstance and look beyond that barrier and ask how is the caretaker manifesting?  Well, for both of them they seem to have an affinity for pets that cannot be satiated.  Rita and Margaret had far more kids than they could afford and my sisters have far more dogs than they can afford.  Somehow, these women just make it work.

Let's look at my younger brother.  Having down-syndrome and having to forfeit much decision-making to his parents, it is hard to know which of his behaviors is not circumstantial.  However, music is one.  Scott has a passion for music, and as soon as he gets internet access in any given place, he navigates straight to his favorite music, the earbuds go in, and he's either singing or dancing.  It is beautiful.  Is it connected to family?  Well, his uncles, with whom he spends less than 1% of his time, might be a tell.  Collectively our uncles own at least 3 pianos, play saxaphone, guitar, keyboard, flute, and basically anything made of wood or metal that can produce sound.  One uncle has a music studio that takes up 50% of his home.  I find it remarkable because Scott's exposure to these uncles is just a tiny, narrow fragment of his life.  They live many miles away from him, they don't have each others phone numbers, and they only see each other on holiday gatherings.  So, you could not possibly claim that scott's love for music was influenced by these individuals - Scott spends one hundred-fold more time with other men whose favorite passtimes are things like golfing and watching sports.  For those of us in the family who are audiophiles (and I am definitely one of them), we didnt _discover_ music; rather, music COMES OUT of us.  I have no doubt at all that if all of our favorite artists vanished before we were born, we would still find a way to have music in our lives. 

So, let's wrap this up before I spend the whole morning writing...

Who is Elle?  A caretaker and a gardener.  A woman with a pet bird. 
Who is Jen?  An adventurer and a caretaker.  A woman who loves animals.
Who is Scott?  A lover of music.  A person with unlimited hugs.  Also, his bones are made of metal (dang I still haven't written this story!)

There is so much more but perhaps that's a good enough start to help my siblings contribute further.  Have a lovely day.

## 12.16 Complete Sentences are a minimum.

In the last few years, I noticed I work harder at communication than some of my close friends and family.  This post is a reminder to everyone: texting only offers 1% of the full communication we were meant to live with.  Let us please respect each other enough to do our best when we text.  The minimal ask is that we give complete sentences.  If you pass me a remark without a complete sentence, I will likely not understand you and I will not reply unless I feel extra generous.

In the future, if I stop replying abruptly, this may be what has happened.  I'd love to have a talk with you, and I'd love for it to have meaning.  A talk without meaning is not something I'll dedicate my time to - I only live once.  Every moment counts.

Think about this:
Through human history we accessed a special set of communication elements that brings an immense context to our chats.  Body language is an umbrella for ten thousand items.  Your facial expression is a subset within those, and tells ten thousand further pieces of information.  I use these cues, in real life but we cannot access them in a text.  Please be kind and don't force the other person to perform all of the work of communication.  You may have them re-reading, guessing, and asking questions about your questions and it can be a big waste of time.  If you perform this on purpose, shame on you for contributing to the disconnection in society today.  If you do it carelessly, please refrain.   Being a good human in the past meant lending a hand, and being a good human in the present means aiming for clarity and helping one another to progress, in any activity, social, business, or otherwise.  

## 12.16 Journal from a painful time

Today I opened up my notes from my journal of 2020.  If you ever wonder what your notes might look like if you earn a Master's in engineering, then marry a PhD biologist, help her graduate, quit your job, move to a foreign place to support her career, face unemployment and isolation with no friends or family, and spend 100 days with a deadly bacteria eating your intestines from the inside, and you still want to have meaning in your life before you die, they might look like this:

## 12.12 How to do life (persistence)

1. You need to want one thing for a long time.  Long enough to get it.
2. you need to get it so that you can find out you didn't want it.
3. you need to do adjust what you want and get that too.
4. you need to execute that process faster so you can execute it several times before death.
5. you need to execute it several times so you can see the trend.
6. you need to see a trend so you can adjust how you decide.
8. you need to adjust how you decide quickly so you can adjust several times before death.
9. you need several adjustments so you can see the pattern of adjustment.
10. you need to see the pattern so you can understand you're not sure how to adjust.
11. you need to lose certainty in your adjustment so you can be sure it isn't in your control.
12. you need to be sure it isn't in your control, to give up control
13. you need to give up control to have peace.

18. you need to have peace so you can let go.
19. you need to let go to be truly happy.

## 12.05 Loving yourself

What if the five love languages apply to loving yourself just as much as any other relationship?  I'll write a bit as I consider it.

1) words of affirmation: wrote in my journal today and affirmed my own goals
2) acts of service: I made myself a lunch yesterday that is serving me today
3) receiving gifts: I received a new Japanese blade for cutting fabric, that I ordered last week.
4) quality time: I really enjoy being in the garden but I don't always do it.  Today I'll spend a little time there to see how the herbs and flowers are coming along.  I'll also check on my iNaturalist app to see if anyone has posted an ID on my upload - a few days back there was a fascinating shrub with berries, and I posted it to find out what type of plant it is.
5) physical touch:  My back has been hurting in the past few days and I didn't give much time to stretch and care for the muscles.  Today I'll get out my foam roller from the closet and do some extra massage work.

I wonder how it would impact my mood if I made sure to exchange each language every day for a week.  I bet it helps.  I bet it's even better if I'm able to provide those things today that arrive tomorrow.  For example, I could set a reminder for Alexa just to deliver some words of affirmation at unexpected times, so I don't have to be the giver and the receipient at the same moment.  I don't want my self-love to be transactional! haha.   I'll ponder this topic for the following week and share if something unexpected comes of it.

Also by the way, I decided I'll get a dog if I'm still lacking consistent relationships (day-to-day ones) on my birthday.  It's about 2 months away, and I already realized a dog does all these things for a man:
1) physical touch (pets & cuddles)
2) words of affirmation (nonverbal)
3) quality time (go for walks)
4) acts of service (fetch me something, greet my visitors, guard the yard)
5) still considering if there is a way I can receive gifts from a dog which aren't brown and smelly.

Take care, everyone!


## 12.01 "My bones are made of Metal"

A quote from my younger brother, Scott.  He had said around age 19 (keep in mind he has down sydrome and sometimes a big imagination) but in this case, there is evidence to back it up!

I began to write this but I had some urgent tasks appear.  I will leave this here as a reminder to write the story soon.


# November 2023

## 11.29 Teach a man to fish

If you give me a fish - I don't need that because I already have my food today.

If you give me a million fish - I don't need that because I can't eat a million fish.  I'll ask you to give it to the other people.

If you teach me to fish, I hope it's a way that I don't already know. And don't forget there's youtube you must compete against.

If you help me teach people to fish, you have my cooperation and my admiration.

## 11.29 Teams of Leaders

What does it look like when a few great leaders collaborate side-by-side?

It's a rare situation and I will explain why, starting with a discussion of trust (again).  I did rush this writing a bit so please forgive if it's not 100% thought out.

Trust is the magic ingredient that allows people to work together most efficiently.  When we make a bridge between technical communication and soft-skills communication, trust is almost required to make progress at a synergistic pace.  Imagine two experts who have experiences in different fields.  To the degree which they share experience, the language matches and the discussion is synchronized down to the detail.  But when teams are diverse, the experiences may vary vastly and there are only two ways to reach forward steps. The first way is to make the listener understand the speaker. The second way is to make the listener trust the speaker.

Understanding the speaker means to define each term, as meticulously as necessary, and where there is a question in the terminology, to define such, and when there is experience required to support the truth of the definition, further explanation to gain buy-in. Consider a team including a teacher and a student. When a teacher explains a grammar rule to a student, the teacher is "onboarding" the student to a matching level of understanding. After a successful lesson, the student (ideally) could then teach the precisely same lesson to another person. Great. The job is done but the team collectively gained no knowledge. In teams, our goal is not to perform a teacher/student relationship to proceed on each plan.  After a decade of an expert's journey, they inevitably carry a great deal of lessons that cannot be summarized in a lesson.  In a team of experts, the collective lessons are immense. If each lesson were to be summarized sufficiently to reach true understanding, the time taken would be immense. 

So, then, if convergence of a 5-member team requires that each team member has fully understood and agreed to the terms for each topic.  In such case we have all "onboarded" one another and the mind is one, with 5 brains.  Sounds cool!  Sounds seamless.  The downside is that we break away all diversity in thought for the topic at-hand.  Agreement requires mutual understanding, mutual understanding requires (if complete) a full set of teacher/student trainings until we all think the same. 

Try to imagine a scenario in your life when there was a true partnership or team of leaders.  It is quite rare.  I'm imagining pilot and copilot - they are both leaders but the copilot doesn't add value unless the pilot is incapacitated.

Imagine a team leader among laborers, such as bricklayers.  Imagine your team leader at work.  Or imagine parents and children (this is the closest example I can think of which is two leaders with equal and diverse value).  When I think of multiple vice presidents in a company, they're each delegated to a sector that is mutually exclusive in its' mission.  When I think of congress or a board of directors of a company, they simply vote on things - their diversity is not leveraged for synergy.

Please for this table of teams, consider synergy to be the "fully unconstrained, multiplication of value."

| relationship | what happens | category | result |
| ------------ | ----- | -------- | -------- |
| teacher/student | match knowledge but add a brain | agreement | no synergy |
| laborers & labor leader | match knowledge but add hands | successful work output | no synergy |
| soccer team | match knowledge but diversify skills | successful performance against another | win a game |
| team of diverse experts | match trust | trust | create new outcomes with synergy |

The soccer team is fascinating because they may synergize enough to be 100x better than the other team in the league but they can still only gain one win per match.

Gotta get back to work.

## 11.28 Streetsweeper Economics

I was in absolute awe, and I felt almost sick to my stomach when I made a realization.  It was 2020 in the midsummer in Malaysia & I lived with my spouse in a gated community, close to her workplace.  I spent tons of time at home, not having any formal employment.  When I went outside to catch fresh air I'd sometimes see folks sweeping the street, in a crew.  The striking thing was the brooms - they were straw brooms, a bit wider than a kitchen broom.  My aesthetically inclined side appreciated such care and attention paid to all of the gardens around me and the beautiful tropical landscaping, worked into the housing complex. Then and my engineering self thought - gee they ought to have some better brooms.  If it were twice as wide, they would have to work half as hard!  Then my former lawn-cutting entrepreneur said "wait why don't they have gasoline powered leafblowers," as I recalled they have many handheld gas machines in this city, even gas-powered fumigating devices (they smelled AWFUL) blown around the parking lots at the mall, with some unknown smoke (not mist, SMOKE) billowing out to cut back the mosquitoes, which looked like something from a dystopian sci-fci.  If I had kids I would have snatched them under my jacket and ran away quickly, assuming the government's mind-control poison was certainly in the mix.  Then my economics self said "then they'd only need 25% of the workforce and 3/4 of people would lose their jobs.  Then my business self said "but then they could actually just expand their terrirtory and keep more of the city clean." and I gradually put it all together, compared with life in the USA.  If it were in the USA, these street-sweepers would be with leafblowers, they would still be immigrants in shabby clothes, and they would still be paid just enough wage that they can't feed their children.  So, that means the scenarios side by side puts 3 workers at the value of one leaf blower.  One leafblower and 1 person replaces four people, in this economic scenario when we fastforward to the future as found in the west.  And I could have almost cried, knowing that the hiring company for this team deliberately decided that three hourly workers was a cheaper option than one leafblower, and surely were paid as such.  I lowered my head in sadness, and shuffled back into my house, noticing on the way some cigarette butts on the ground.  Since there's no fall season, the scant amount of leaves on the ground was less noticeable than the cigarette butts.  Only the british and the chinese smoked and would toss their cigarettes on the ground in my area.  And there were garbage pails just a meter away.  My heart was so heavy.  The kings and queens of the gated commmunity, chinese and british imports, littered their own private drives because they knew someone less valuable than a leaf-blower would be there the next day to sweep it up.  I feel depressed just thinking about it.  These humans were no different than the privileged humans in my country.

Fast forward to mid 2023, and I saw the video from my work colleague of our robot with the little boy, one of many with a brand new opportunity to rise out of his economic caste - whose future would surely change from such limited jobs as sweeping streets, to getting real opportunities in true modern technology, degreed or not, with a pathway to rise above the ugly reality I had seen in 2020, and I did celebrate alone at home in Texas, with music and dancing, just imagining that victory is imminent and I know how it will look as we approach it. More about that image in my [robotics blog post here](https://www.scuttlerobot.org/updates/blog/we-made-an-impact/).

## 11.20 Wisdom is

Knowledge is learning from what you do.  Wisdom is learning from what you did.

We experience all of our life situations & with success or failure, we can learn.  But at the time of the event, our perspective is limited, naturally.  Down the road we can look back at an old experience and unlock entirely new lessons that were not captured the first time around.  Every year, in fact, you might gain a perspective that unlocks a lesson from Year 10.  That means, By year 30, you can gain 20 lessons from year 10 instead of just 1.  And so it follows, at some point you build a skill to absorb a lesson from some place that is not in the present, and this is probably a skill rather than an automatic feature of a human.  If you learn the skill, you can then just as easily extract wisdom from another person's story, and every person who interacts with you becomes of value if you only listen to them, and listen well.

## 11.15 Meditating since Age 13

I had no idea I was doing it.  Nobody instructed me.  In fact, I got odd looks when I told people about these types of things.  I suffered from depression as early as maybe age 11.  That is when I started cutting grass for neighbors so that I could have a few bucks so that I could have a nintendo-64 that all of my friends had.  It was an awful feeling hanging around other kids who would spend the entire day at school talking only about something that didn't include you.  It was this or that game, the levels they reached, the characters they unlocked, etc.  I don't recall the age of getting diagnosed but I do recall telling my mom and my therapist in a room "I wish I was born in Africa so I didn't have to feel jealous of my friends toys."  Thinking about the age and that self-evaluation, i'm still stunned.  No idea what inspired those words in me.

It's been less than a year, starting somewhere in early 2023 that I tried guided meditation and learning about what meditation is.  After some months, I stumbled on two areas interwoven with meditation:  connecting with nature and adapting surroundings for calm inputs to the senses.  There are now plenty of "white noise" and "bineural beats" audio tracks on Youtube for playing and helping with serenity, focus, etc.  Regarding nature, it's pretty well known that natural surroundings enhance your inner peace to help reach a state of meditation. For both of these areas, I recently realized I had specific methods in the past that executed on the need. One for nature and one for sensory stuff.

Here are two methods I learned by myself as a child.  1) climbing a tree.  When I got too irritated, too depressed, or upset I climbed a tree and just stayed there.  There was one very climbable dogwood next door that eventually had worn down bark from how often I went there. I had a branch to sit.  I had alone time.  I had no real reason to go there, and to this day I don't know why I did it.  I don't know if it helped.  But spending a little energy, fuming a bit until someone eventually called me in for dinner or went looking for me; that resolution which involved a little bit of being needed back in real life - this must have had a positive effect.  The second one was 2) super long showers with an auditory enhancement.  There were two factors that led to this.  first, my family got one of those shower heads that had a "massage mode" centering the stream into one jet in the center.  Secondly, I had a buzz-cut hair cut on a few occasions and the water could spray neatly onto my scalp.  One day the shampoo suds dripped into my ears and I heard a magnificent amplified woosh of the water, almost from inside the skull - not from the outside.  And I learned that I could plug my ears with my fingers, and just listen to all other sounds fade out except for this overwhelming waterfall sound from the inside of my ears.  It was calming, it spanned a very wide range of the audible spectrum (low and high and in between) except for sharp high pitches, and with the eyes closed it immediately let your mind imagine anything you wanted to imagine.  All distractions were cleared.  So, sometimes I would do this for multiple minutes until I felt guilty about wasting water and just listened and relaxed.  This habit was left behind as soon as we moved homes, never to return and totally forgotten.  It troubles me to realize I left behind my tree too.  Fast forward about 20 years, and I realize these were very healthy ways to bring a state of calm.  And, that there's nothing wrong with spending some time doing absolutely nothing at all.  In the pace of our society, and my job with 10 different roles, I probably should bring them both back soon.

## 11.08 It will happen.

Trust it.  Dream big - it's not a silly phrase, it's real.  I can guarantee you if you set your sights on an incredible goal, you'll either find what you are after or you'll be presented with a path just as grand and with an even better outcome.  Keep the open mind as you go. 

My synchronicities are stacking up too fast to even explain.  Last evening I worked until 9:45pm and went to a nice wine bar for one cocktail.  The few visitors were dwindling and the bartenders were cleaning up the space.  I thought about trying one more establishment to interact with some people, but it was already almost 11pm.  One barkeeper said to another "hey want to go to ____" after this?  And I thought, that's funny because it's the same one I was thinking to go to.  So instead of returning home I proceeded to the next spot.  The bar had a dozen seats and just one open spot, and I ordered some food and a water.  The 55 year old man on my left, I paid no attention while I chatted with the two barkeepers I saw for a second time.  He strikes up a conversation with me.  Keep in mind, I have only ever met blue collar folks at this bar and I enjoy talking with people who do real hands-on work in their lives, so I wasn't expecting to find out that this gentleman works for the second biggest x86 processor company in the world.  This is the next company I think we need to integrate into our robotics company since we already have TI, Intel, Nvidia, and Broadcom integrated.  I thought he may be able to help me learn the best approach.  Instead of diving deep into tech stuff, a few remarks I can't recall moved the conversation towards relationships. I said "maybe you can share some wisdom with me" in some kind of context about marriage.  He said in his predicament, he's the one in need of wisdom. He is amid a painful situation because his wife and 2 children are overseas in a country in the middle east.  The marriage, residency, greencard, and student loan (quarter million dollars) are all intertwined in an impossible muck. He feels his wife and children are not safe, understandably.  He tried everything - speaking with lawyers, friends, reaching out to the government officials, but nobody has any experience with his described situation.  And my mind was blown because my 2021 had precisely the same elements he is facing now.  International spouse, greencard challenges, massive student debt demanded by the foreign government, slow-moving administrations, impossibly low wages in the foreign country, unsafe conditions in the foreign country at the time of the matter, and the foreign government essentially holding the spouse hostage, with leverage of multiple cosigners on the debt contract in the foreign country who collectively would be put on the streets even if all of their life assets were sold to pay for the debt.  My ex-spouse and I worked through all of that.  We overcame it, too.  And there I was, the only person I've ever heard of in this situation, sitting next to another person in this situation.  We exchanged contacts and I am hoping that I can help.  The computers and robotics can wait for later.

The odds are impossible.  This type of impossible interaction is happening so frequently now that I rarely try to describe or explain to anyone.  It's a choice of participating or mulling over why things are the way they are.  Embrace the moment.  This too shall pass.

## 11.07 Electrically grounding the bed

It may sound silly but electrically grounding my body overnight has healed my injuries.  I recently watched [this documentary](https://youtu.be/44ddtR0XDVU) about the body's need to have a path to electrical ground for all of our molecular-level processes. With every bit of knowledge from my engineering & biology interactions, it's sound science.  So, I used carbon fiber engrained ESD cloth laid on my bed and connected to ground.  [This is the cloth](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TOKQ57E) I ordered, which appears to trace back to Burlington textile company and does in fact measure 5mm spacing with little black threads of carbon fiber.  I verified with a multimeter the resistance along the threads is much lower than an insulator. My sleep was incredibly good and this cannot possibly be all explained without some audio

## 11.02 Allegory of the River Cell

If I die tomorrow and I can only share one thing with the world, it may be this allegory.  I do not have any logical reason why, but it feels important right now.  The following text is a first draft and it does need some further writing to become complete.

**The layout** 

Imagine that your life takes place from birth to death inside of a special kind of cell.  It's a magic jail cell with some good and bad aspects.  The bad news is that you're all alone. The good news is that you can have anything that you want. 

The cell is a large room with a small river running through it, let's say the size of a basketball court.  It's a rectangle you cannot escape from, but you can wish for anything that you want.  If you wish for a steak dinner, you can have it instantly, and it flows in via the river, such that you could have yourself a whole dining place with a table, chairs, and your dinner.  It arrives when you're ready to use it, and there you have it in your cell for as long as you wish to use it.

**The experience, part A**

Any item that you finish using, will vanish from the cell.  For this reason, the limits of the space inside the cell are not very relevant. If you wish for any item, it will flow into the river and you may have it immediately. If you stop using it, it will vanish.  If you materially change it, it will flow out of the cell through the river exit.

For example, if you are a child and you want a soccer ball, it arrives and you may play.  At the very last time that you touch the ball, it will vanish. Only God knows when the last time is, just as in real life you cannot recall the last time that you played with your favorite ball.  The vanishing element has no real impact on your possessions overall, since you have full control of how long you wish to have things.  In that regard, you have no worries about your items vanishing. 

**The experience, Part B**


There are some items that do not vanish upon your last use.  These are items we will call art. If you materially change something, it will exit the cell but not by vanishing.  It will be deposited into the river and flow out of the cell, and into the world.  For example, if you whittle a block of wood into a turtle figurine, the figurine will flow out of the cell and the scraps of wood will vanish.  

Given the physics of the cell, one could stand outside your cell at the South and discover somewhat of a story of your life. By logic, anything that flows out of the cell was materially handled by you, and says something about you. Everything you've not impacted will vanish, because it isn't part of your story.  Your story, for the sake of terminology, is the full collection of items which have flown from your cell with it's chronology and every detail. Just as in real life, the items not materially changed by you have no mark of your existence.  (In real life, one could make the philosophical argument that perhaps all things exiting your life do in fact vanish, as there is no proof to you that it still exists). If another person wishes to prove your past belonging still exists, they would need to wish it into their respective cell, and it will appear in the same way that they imagined it. 

For an example of art, if you write a poem on a piece of paper, the paper will flow out of the cell and enter the world.  The unused paper vanishes, along with the pen or pencil you used. It remains in existence and it is linked to your individual story.

**Art**

In this allegory, every item conciously impacted by you, and materially impacted, is the only thing that exists after your life is over.  Art requires no skill, only attention and effort.  Skill is permitted but not required.

A very simple example of art may be a rubics cube.  If you wish one day for a rubics cube and you play with it, fiddling without intention, then it does not earn a place in your story and it vanishes.  If you solve the cube, even halfway, or even to a small degree it has been modified with intention, it will flow into your story when you're finished.  We call this art because there is no success or failure in your actions.  Perhaps your intention with the cube was to generate one face with a checkerboard pattern, of yellow and blue.  If you succeed or even partially succeed, the art populates your story.

![image-rubiks](https://github.com/dmalawey/blog/assets/42623372/c07b6b22-2b12-411b-a9db-7d6b3ce16bdc ':class=image-25')

You may become skillfull and create bigger things if you wish. Noah's ark became part of his story, not during the planning, not during the collection of materials, but when the first board was cut into the desired shape to build the hull.

**Restrictions**

You may wish for anything, but under one condition you will not receive it.  If the item does not exist, you cannot have it.  Existentials are items which either can be found in nature or have been made by another person, at any time in history.  Existentials are comprised of every item that has every been made, not only those which you can find in the modern present time. So, in your cell you may wish for a 5-dollar currency note and it appears, but if you wish for a 6-dollar currency note it probably does not exist; therefore you cannot have it. However, you can make it, and it's easy. If you really wanted a six-dollar currency note for some reason, you may wish for all of the tools to make it, and have the tools instantly. You may wish for the entire printing press, and the computer with its collection of templates for US Dollar currency.  We can admit that you probably would not wish for any currency, since you can have everything you want for free - then suddenly all of the currency in the world has no purpose - but this is not entirely true. You may wish for instructions to operate the machines, and you may wish for a quick-start guide instead of the 400 page manual that comes along with the printing press ink reservoir.  As long as the quick start guide is an existential, you may have it immediately.  Otherwise, you may only have the full manual and it may take much more time for you to make your 6-dollar note.

**Layers of art**

Written into the currency, there are details which are art.  The face of hamilton on my 10 dollar bill is art that was made by an illustrator.  This face, in whichever medium it was formed (perhaps pencil on paper, or perhaps later as a digital design on a thumb drive), exists as art, somewhere, totally separate from the note itself, and comes from the story of the individual who illustrated it.  Further along in history, the placement of president Hamilton on the near-center of a note, adorned with geometric patterns, exists yet again but without the serial number JB7760653A, as found on my 10-dollar bill today.  Further still, the individual note with my specific serial number, became existential when a person made it.   Notice that these three items (the portrait, the note design, and the final serialized note) are three separate existentials linked to three different individuals in history.

**Broader view**

Now let us review existentials with a step back in perspective. They are everything that exists and everything that ever has existed materially.  They can be broken down into art and nature.  Art is an item that is coupled to an individual's intention and nature is everything that exists without human intention.  We hereby have a new definition for art and nature for this allegory.

With these new definitions, we can explore all existentials as art, nature, and in a sense, combinations.  There are no blends of art and nature in the existential itself, but there are blends in the stories only.  A raspberry seed may be planted by an individual and grow into a bush.  The bush itself is nature and it bears more nature, in the fruit, and so on.  Nature requires no intention; it just happens.  What happens to the intention that was set in the action of planting the seed?  The answer is easier to offer with an adjusted situation.

If you choose to plant three raspberries, your intention was delivered in only the placement.  They may be spaced 1 meter apart from one another, and this spacing is where your intention materially impacted the other existentials.  Collectively, your row of three berry plants with 1-meter spacing, is a work of art.  Your story includes this art, a small garden consisting of 3 plants that exist through nature.

**Time's impact**

If you do not return to your garden (or wish it into your cell) then nature may take hold and dissolve your art, or anything that can happen which naturally happens.  The bushes may grow healthy, or perhaps two of the three plants exist after a year has passed, and your art is reduced from a row of three plants to a row of only two plants.  In this case, your art may dissolve forever.  Everything else in nature carries on just as in the real world.  So, if you are knowledgeable about gardening, you understand the proper spacing, and if you (as completely permitted) enhance your odds of your art's survival by watering and other care, then this art remains part of your story.


_I'll need to pause here and continue on another day.  This is the first ever draft of my allegory of the river cell._

## 10.29 Engineering is Magic

Last Halloween I attended a party where the host hired a magician.  The party-goers took a break from the music, pulled up chairs, and watched with so much attention that the cell phones remained in people's costume pockets.  Over a series of tricks, I heard the murmuring periodically of friends chatting about their thoughts of the mechanisms or slight of hand that made the magic happen.  The tricks involved things like matching playing cards, and copying the serial number from a dollar bill without looking at the paper note. I thought to myself, first: it's pretty impressive and it must have taken years of practice to have such consistent results.  He nailed almost every trick without a blooper. Surely he has some of his tougher tricks that he practices off-stage, still improving his skills.  I admired the work.  For a moment I felt a desire to be a magician.  It must feel good. A big applause concluded the 30 minute show, and smiles were everywhere.  

Sometimes I wish that I had an applause, or just a thank-you for my hard work in engineering.  I recall at Toyota I put in TONS of hours to make the exhaust cleaner, the car run smoothly, and maximize power and long engine life for a vehicle that serves tens of thousands of customers - I wished occasionally that I could just tell a stranger how hard I worked on their product, and hear back that they loved the results and it makes them so happy.  

It struck me at the end of the magic show, that engineers basically perform magic.  We create results in real life, and most people have no idea how it works, but they don't stop to discuss amongst each other "how did he do it!!?" with excitement and wonder.  And when we finish the show, the magic keeps on working repeatably for years or decades.  Imagine a group of young mothers in a specialty magic show in 1950.  An engineer walks onto a stage with a magic box.  He places inside the box a whole pile of dirty dishes.  He presses a magic button, and proceeds with the other tricks.  At the end of the show, he opens the magic box and all of the dishes are clean and dry.  It's pure magic!  A box that turns dirty dishes clean!  He would wrap up the show, grab a cold beer, and join the party as the desirable alpha guy who dazzles and charms.  That's how engineering magic works, minus the social side.

Maybe as an engineering educator I can use this concept to help learners have extra pride in their work and realize the whole modern world runs on their efforts.  It would be a kind of social boost I think engineers need to feel as they work and practice.

## 10.23 I want a date with [Ella Marija](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorde)

I was listening to the song "Team" by Lorde this morning and it's almost perfect.  "We live in cities you'll never see on screen.  Not very pretty but we sure know how to run things."  She is originally from New Zealand, with parents from Croatia.  I might not understand the original meaning but that's the beauty of art - it carries meaning for me. Croatia and New Zealand, compared with most of the western world, maintains a gorgeous natural environment instead of building sky-high towers that cast shadows over the beach.  In the developing countries where I have visited - guatemala, brazil, malaysia - the strength of commerce hasn't grown so powerful that it consumes our attention and we completely miss the point of life that's communicated to us with our natural surroundings.  The humans in all of these places are connected and we want the same things.  We just cannot see it.  The developed nations with relaxed economies like New Zealand are gems because they can help us bridge the communication between 1st and 3rd worlds.

"And you know, we're on each other's team" - these words could have resolved every conflict in my life this decade, both personal and in business. If only it were understood by both sides.  I won't go into detail because the lyrics say it all.

In any case, If you know Ella, please tell her I'd like to take her out for dinner.

## 10.22 Trust is Power

We talk about a lot of distrust these days.  I'd claim we implement trust in people 100x more often than we implement distrust, and we don't even notice it most of the time.  But trust enables us to advance a thousand times further than living without trust.  For an example, I'll describe the choice of people who drive cars - when you climb into a car, you're trusting tens of thousands of engineers, technicians, lawmakers, and even writers to keep you safe.  Let's dive in. 

Inside of my 14 year old Toyota 4runner, there are dozens of things that can EXPLODE and cause harm to me.  Here's a list:
* The Fuel in the tank can explode, if any spark is available near the path of the fuel.
* The battery can explode, especially where hydrogen gas can release from the electrolyte fluid.
* The nav display has a lithium battery, and it can explode if punctured.
* There are four tires which can explode from pressure, any rubber puncture, or chemical that weakens the tire.
* There is a spare tire, which can also explode under pressure.
* The oil pan below the engine contains gas fumes, and it can explode if it is struck while driving.
* The head gasket and aluminum heads could explode, if the cylinder pressure is too high.
* There is an airbag directly in my steering wheel, which is designed to explode, but hopefully not at the wrong time.
* There are 4 more airbags that can explode, all with potentially lethal force, in the columns and passenger side.
* At highway speeds, each of the drivetrain elements can explode due to binding or friction, including but not limited to:
  * driveshaft and u-joint
  * rear differential
  * front differential
  * transmission discs
  * wheel bearings
  * (each of the above contains metal heavier than a hammer, rotating at thousands of RPM, with more energy than a lethal bullet, enough to fly off and easily pass through a person.
* The air conditioner contains pressurized aluminum & steel tubes, routing straight into the cabin, carrying VERY high pressure, containing toxic chemicals, and several joints and tubes that can explode.
* I keep a fire extinguisher in the vehicle, which contains high pressure and metal, and could explode if it fails, with toxic chemicals.
* The serpentine belt made of fiber-reinforced synthetic rubber, wrapped around multiple steel discs in the front of the engine, all rotating 10x faster than a kitchen blender blade, and 10x the weight of a baseball, each can explode from rotating energy.
* The exhaust manifold, less than 1 meter from the driver, carrying hundreds of PSI of toxic gasses at 800 degrees fahrenheit, glowing red with heat daily, could explode.
* Each of the four shock absorbers, with cylinders reaching THOUSANDS of PSI at moments of striking a bump, carrying toxic oils, could explode by a seal failure.
* Two rubber tubes in my steering system, the thickness of a sharpie, carrying easily 1200 PSI, and toxic lubricant, could explode due to hose failure.

This is just a 5-minute list of things on the car that could explode under ordinary use, and I am trusting everyone from the design engineers to the technicians to the metallurgists who authored descriptions 50 years ago of how to make the chemistry of the metals that are used to make each part strong enough, still used today in the components that hopefully won't explode.  Just imagine, I could make a list of equal length for the number of ways each component could fail; explosion is only one type of potentially-lethal failure.

Every moment that you live in society, you're trusting thousands of humans to keep you safe, putting your life in the hands of complete strangers, some of whom have passed away many years ago.  Some of them had beliefs you dislike.  Some of them had bad habits you disagree with.  Some of them made remarks that would offend you.  Some of them had a bad temper, some with a criminal record, some doing their jobs amidst a life crisis.  And they put their efforts into creating convenience for you which laid a path for your success.

Somewhere in Guatemala there is a nineteen year old boy in a forest of rubber treees, harvesting liquid sap from the bark of a tree with his bare hands, collecting it into a coffee can that will get poured into a bucket of liquid rubber resin that will go into a truck and make it's way to Goodyear Tire & Rubber company in Topeka, Kansas.  He hasn't finished high school, he has harvested 10,000 sap-cans, he's got to do this to pay for his younger sister to take English classes, to advance enough to MAYBE get a modern education, and he has seen the lavish American lifestyle of complaining about a cracked phone screen on a phone that costs as much as his family's food for the next year, and you are trusting him to NOT contaminate the rubber that goes into that high-pressure hose in your power-steering system in your car which, upon failure, could end your life.  Wow, what an incredible situation of trust.

I think we would regain some faith in humanity if we only _noticed_ how much we trust others.  The trouble is that we are trusting thousands of times per day, but we aren't consciously choosing it.  If we could notice the times we are passively trusting, we could change it to a behavior of actively choosing trust, and engrain the pattern of choosing trust and discovering the rewards.  If you drove to work today and you trusted your vehicle, you can obviously see how the choice of trusting versus walking to work got you there faster and more comfortably.  Let us begin to correlate our success with our trust so that the correlation becomes undeniably obvious!  Everything you have done in your life that you are proud of - it was only made possible through trust.  Maybe with that mindset we could have gratitude for the times we trusted others and it brought us good results.

As my business grows and I see the path it is taking, my results are tenfold greater when I have trusted others. I don't always agree with my colleagues and partners but for every disagreement there are 100 unspoken agreements, and recognizing them makes it clear that all of my power to expand my efforts comes from trusting others.  The more I can manage to trust, the more leverage I have to build new exciting outcomes.  I hope others can see this as well as I can see it. 

## 10.18 We Forgot How to Mechanical Engineer

I believe that americans and many first world countries have completely forgotten how to perform mechanical engineering.  I believe phrases like "this functions like clockwork" comes from the time when we knew how to build clocks, and when any intricate multimaterial, fine-tuned mechanical system was approachable by most mechanical engineers.  I believe that a mechanical engineer who does not build things is like a software engineer who does not write software.  The problem roots in the fact that our economy creates spaces for our engineers to be VERY HIGHLY PAID to specialize so deeply within a machine that their knowledge stops when they exit school, and it is the reason most mechanical engineers do not even repair their own cars and household items.  I intend to help fix this.  I think that countries like India, Russia, Malaysia, and developing nations have highly skilled mechanical engineers who know how to work with ranges of materials & substances, who use a greater fraction of their knowledge, and are able to solve the small problems in society that turn our appliances and machines into landfill stuff.  The economic constraint of having only what is needed (not a massive surplus of cheap goods as we have in the USA) means that high-value materials never arrive on the curb and they make their way into a new function at vastly higher rates than they do in the USA, Singapore, France, Germany, etc.   

Mark my words:  As the [manufacturing economy re-localizes](https://youtu.be/JHDYf18AYfI) to some degree (this is evidenced by many economists) and more products are made locally once again in developed nations, we will have a rise in the cost of goods, appliances will become more coveted once again, and re-use and repair will recover as a part of our society, or in some cases automation will take the place of millions of cheap devices.  In 2019 I found two Keurig coffee machines for free on the curbside: only in America would you find something like this, wherein one [disconnected wire or a leaky tube](https://youtu.be/kLjtxc7-g9E) inside of the machine prevented it from functioning as good as new - and in 2026 we will see this situation replaced with fewer machines.  In path A: the machine prices will rise and become fewer in sales, or path B: the household keurig will subside and be replaced by on-demand coffee delivered by robots, drones, or bulk delivery services.  It is too costly and unsustainable to distribute machines so complex and high in technology components, as these components were manufactured globally and the global workers are earning enough money to change their standard of living.  Chinese laborers are becoming middle class, and more of their inventions will stay in-country.  Shipping routes are becoming expensive and increasing in risk due to situations like the [Panama Canal](https://youtu.be/6GI0zANA3S4) and the [Suez Canal](https://youtu.be/Ty-m4pm8oog) problems recently.  Quality must rise, Quantity must fall, and I hope that our skillsets become more focused on meeting normal needs.

In 2012 my job at Toyota largely revolved around computing costs of component manufacture in the USA, Japan, and Mexico, wherein the logistics cost battled the currency exchange ratios for the tipping point of local or remote parts manufacturing.  As the tipping points slowly move towards reduced exportation (from all nations) and the global impact of shipping becomes burdened with planted-preservation directives, jobs like mine in 2012 will refocus on the mechanical designs instead of computing dollar figures.  I complained heavily to my team that I felt I was not using my engineering skills learned in school.  These issues will slowly adjust.  Engineers who are directed to perform business-engineering instead of mechanical engineering will once again have a space to solve mechanical problems, and this is good.

Through my robotics organization I intend to support this adjustment by publishing more and more educational information that allows experienced and brilliant minds to return to their true skillset: creating value by making solutions in the engineering space instead of in the economics space.  It's going to take a big community and many years but it will be ever-enjoyable and very rewarding. 

## 10.15 What your salary says about you

Salary measures how much you hate your job.  I know folks won't enjoy reading that but hear me out...  The things you enjoy, you do for free:  hug your family, walk your dog, fetch a cool glass of water.  The things you REALLY enjoy, you'll pay money for:  Eat dinner at a high class italian joint, Park in the premium space downtown, take a vacation in Cozumel.  People I know who really love a type of work, such as buiding pottery or writing a blog: they do these activities for no pay at all.  One of my friends at the Toyota Design engineering group back in 2012 had a hefty $80k salary (fresh out of college, 1 year experience), and spent his work week designing parts of transmissions which would later go into the Sienna or the Highlander.  After work, our friends group would socialize at a small bar in Ypsilanti and he would show up later than everyone... on a 30 year old, slow, rickety moped.  I asked about it, and he said he spent the last 3 hours modifying the exhaust pipe of the scooter to get a certain performance out of the tiny 50CC engine.  I couldn't believe that he was engineering by day and continuing engineering by night. How could he work on something so unimportant while he spent his work week doing engineering for vehicles in mass production? The truth is, he didn't really love the time he spent at the desk, but Toyota wouldn't pay him to put on gloves and take engines apart. He loved certain parts of engineering.  And the very specific activities that brought him joy - he would gladly do for free.  Nobody would buy his scooter, nobody would ever even know about the brilliant engineering inside the exhaust port of this one old ugly scooter somewhere in Michigan.  No reward except for the job itself. 

Yesterday my Texan friend spoke of a lawyer he knows who charges $10,000 per hour.  That means 10 seconds of his time costs $27.  He must really hate his job.  Imagine, if he visits his parents and hugs them 10 seconds. Does he charge them the appropriate 54 dollars?  Nobody charges their parents for hugs, so I guess those hugs were worth $57 to him. On the other hand, answering a client's email is worth -$57 to him.  He must really hate emails. He is probably not so unique. Maybe it's time to do more hugging in the world and less emailing.

From a business perspective, an employer asks "how much do I have to pay this person to make them do something?"  When I was 13, I walked up the street to some workers digging up the sewer, fascinated and curious.  (I loved digging holes and perhaps they got closer to China than I did).  Two men had shovels and one man operated the backhoe.  The operator was the only one not sweating.  The men in the trench informed me "If you work like us for 15 years then you get to drive the backhoe, and he gets paid double!"  So today I'm verifying my logic: does that man dislike the backhoe operation twice as much as he disliked shovel-work?  It musn't be so, right?  The truth is he had to offer 15 years of work at a low wage to get his first year in the backhoe.  So, looking at the exchange of 1 year of backhoe-operation - it's actually 15 years of shovel work plus a year of running the machine.  So basically the backhoe payment is a FUTURE payment for the workers with shovels.  The payment is withheld until 15 years. They get to go home tired and sweaty daily and tell their wives that they really should keep going because soon they'll get to do something they like more, and the family will get more cash too.  The shovel workers would switch to the backhoe any day for no extra pay.  But the extra cash is to make it look better on paper, and make it easier for the workers to justify the first 15 years to their friends and family. 

Every minute of your life is equal.  When you reach your death bed you won't talk about your life and your work-life separately. So, what parts of your day do you really enjoy?  Can you make that into a larger part of your life?  Maybe it would make the world a better place.

## 09.05 Embracing Diversity in Language

I was born in 1989 and grew up in the midwest.  Most of us have learned only English in spoken languages, and this fact has been subjected to innumerable discussions as I traveled the world and as years have passed.

Recently, I noticed a friend of mine who is native to Malaysia and speaks Malay (bahasa-melayu) but is fluent in English, some of his spoken words are different than mine and observing this really ties together the challenges of language in my life, mostly rooted in folks making assumptions.  Biases and assumptions are the enemy, not culture differences and language barriers.  For this discussion, let us give the name colleague Nazmi.

In a meeting, Nazmi made a remark like "our team is interacting with the developers of a so-called grocery robot" and I noticed his use of the phrase "so-called." In Missouri (perhaps in North America) his comment would imply that there is not in fact a grocery robot but it carries this title nevertheless. Specifically, it feels that the [predicative nominative](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-predicate-nominative-and-direct-object) of the sentence is not in fact what it is called.  We Americans often make remarks with distain such as "the so-called leader of our country can't even find the podium on his stage."  We intend to say the person carries a title but the title does not carry truth.  

Because of my frequent interactions with Nazmi, I knew that there was no disdain implied, and no doubts about the legitimacy about the grocery robot.  But, I felt an impulse to clarify for the whole group.  Usually I try to be an administrator of clarity but I let it go and I just observed how the others received the comments. It appeared, there was sufficient open-mindedness that folks in the meeting did not become confused and in the following minutes Nazmi used the phrase several more times, with a respectful tone towards the "so-called" this or that.  Nazmi had his own connotations for "so-called" and I realized there is not a rule to be followed.  Instead of offering clarity for others, maybe I need more observation.

Over the years, I think I've learned bits of many languages but more about **human communication** when speaking different flavors of English.  One year of coursework in Japanese, one year of high school spanish, and many years speaking portuguese with my friends and former spouse.  Again and again, I learn from non-native or other-native english speakers **IF** I keep an open mind.

Last week at Lowes I was helped by a worker, born in the middle east.  I asked where he's from.  He said Pakistan.  I told him "Welcome to America." He replied "I've been here thirty years." And with a smile, I replied "I still noticed your accent so I decided to say welcome."  He felt that I was kind and genuine but still made a defense: "It's because I speak three languages, sir."  Later as I drove home, I pondered if I should quit welcoming people who have been here a long time. The risk of such a welcome is that they'll assume I am sarcastic. But in 30 years, don't you think he has sometimes doubted whether he is welcome? Don't you think he deserves some reassurance?  Do you think he will find reassurance on news and social media? If not, then where? I am sure there are pains in his life in America as a middle eastern native. Why should anyone have to make an explanation for having an accent? In the future, if he has more experiences of strangers being warm and accepting of him and simultaneously discussing accents, I bet it will help him realize his accent is a great thing. One cannot heal a pain without going near the topic of the pain.

#### Other bits, to be listed as superficial observations but which I've introspected enough to write a book:
* 2023 In a discussion on reddit where I spoke of diversity, I received insulting remarks among which were an attack of my abilities in writing.  The irony of someone assuming I don't embrace diversity and simultaneously judging my language skillset - this would make a great discussion.  Lesson: we need to reconsider what it means to have an open accepting mind.
* 2018 A german biologist, fluent in English, has corrected my proper English usage in a social barbecue setting.  Her remarks essentially said "you should know better," and "why are my English skills better than those of Americans?" with a presumed conclusion that Americans do not make a strong effort to use our language properly. She was inclined to aim for properness but she was married to a man from Costa Rica who speaks only a bit of English.  He heard the whole interaction.  Lesson: How could he feel accepted while observing his German-native English-speaker delivering judgement of an American's English skillset?
* 2021 In a social setting, a close friend of mine (American) reprimanded me for offering a correction to a Brazilian-native in English.  The Brazilian-native was my wife, and she desired to refine her English as much as possible for her success in developing her career (focused on scientific literature).  For two years I did not make corrections in public because it may be embarrassing.  She and several of my Brazilian friends had expressed frustration that they can't improve from Good-to-great in English because nobody informs them of minor errors.  I opened a new mindset to be willing to make corrections in realtime.  It would seem I can't do this without assumptions made of me. Lesson: In the 3-party interaction, each person can have what they wish for, only if nobody makes assumptions about the goodwill of others.
* 2007 A teenage David had a distaste for popular rap music, which carried themes I disagreed with morally, but also had grammar that would fail in 6th grade American schools.  I **judged** it was garbage. By 2009 in college my peers would make jokes about my utter void in good party music and I defended that it's objectively rubbish, and it's existence was a cultural degradation for listeners, because it's English made no sense. (remember, this was young David). In the same year, I participated in Engineers Without Borders traveling to Guatemala and joyfully embraced the broken English of my counterparts as we engineered clean water for families.  The irony is that my embracing of language had nothing to do with objective properness. It was just a mask for whether I embraced a culture.  *Before one can embrace a culture, they must admit they don't know the culture* and my huge error was believing that Missouri had one culture. I thought that my mind was so very open! Lesson: I assumed Missouri culture was one box, defined by what school teaches. I believed that because I was taught in school that one sentence format was right and one sentence format was wrong.  From there, it was easy to **judge** if a student was doing right or wrong.  It took another 15 years of my own style of open-mindedness for me put these experiences together and adjust my mindset to resolve the cognitive dissonance.  That journey could be a whole book in itself so I will not summarize the lesson today.  Lesson element: don't allow your cultural assumptions into your interpretation of language.

## 08.23 Meal Prep^4

When I'm depressed I don't even have drive to cook for myself.  This year, my best friend (happy David) gave me an awesome gift to help out during those times.  He meal prepped for me, and more. It's really starting to change things.  If you have a best friend as good as mine, ask if they'll help you do things like this.

## 08.21 Welcome to America.

I've spoken these words many times, and occasionally I'm told by Americans that it's offensive. I respect that opinion but I disagree.  Their concern is that it sounds that we have claimed the whole continent in referring to my country. This would be concerning for me too, but I am certainly not claiming the whole continent for my country and I have never met someone who does this, so far.

This phrase is English for "Welcome to the United States of America" in American-English, since Americans often abbreviate their country name when speaking.  The fact that we abbreviate is common knowledge among English native speakers in the USA, Canada, and Europe.  For these people, it's okay to use the phrase because they know it is spoken with kindness - except for a select few who have distain and poor assumptions about Americans and you may enjoy abbreviating just to troll them 🙂.

**Here are some phrases I use to welcome people with consideration for their background:**
* If I wish to welcome a spanish-speaker to the USA, I say "bienvenido a America."
* If I wish to welcome a Mexican spanish-speaker to the USA, I say "bienvenido a Los Estados Unidos." I would not say "bienvenido a America" because they already came from the American continent and that might infer a claim to the continent. If you said this phrase to a Mexican or Latino spanish speaker I agree it may be offensive and I personally don't use that phrase to greet a Latino.
* If I wish to welcome a close friend is Mexican and returning to the USA, I tell them "welcome to America" with a grin and we both understand it is a joke.
* If I wish to welcome a close friend who is Brazilian I use "bem vindo a America" to the same effect.
* If I wish to welcome an acquaintence who is Brazilian I use "welcome to America" with a smile and if she is a woman, with a kiss on the cheek per Brazilian culture (and most latino cultures).  I use body language to show that it is a genuine welcoming and I use the english phrase in my American accent so that they can become familiar with the phrase, and establish if they hear that phrase during the rest of their travel, it has a warm meaning. 
* If I wish to welcome a mexican friend in a professional setting of mostly spanish speakers I use "bienvenido a los Estados Unidos."
* If I wish to welcome a mexican acquaintence in a professional setting of mostly English speakers, I use "welcome to the United States."
* If I wish to welcome an acquaintence from Europe and I do not know what language they speak, I use "welcome to America" so they become familiar with my accent.
* If you wish to welcome an English speaker from Canada to the United States, you can say "welcome to the USA" or "welcome to America." It isn't offensive because in Canada it's common knowledge that US people abbreviate United States of America with just America.
* If I am welcoming a Canadian, I use "welcome to Texas" because they probably already feel welcome in the United States. 
* If I am in latin america and I greet a person who arrived from overseas, I use "welcome to america" or "bienvenido a america" to let them know I am aware America is a continent and that Americans like myself do not claim the word America for the United States.

I have never met an American who claims the whole continent by calling themselves Americans.  If you meet someone who feels that way, I recommend you learn where that feeling comes from and maybe we can help make adjustments.


## 08.21 I woke up and immediately faced an engineering problem.

It's a normal morning. I wake up, and the first thing I have to do is solve an engineering problem:  The problem is aiming a nozzle into a bowl. The nozzle is 44 inches (1.1m) off the ground, pointed 60 degrees above horizontal, and the bowl is 17 inches (0.4m) above the floor; the target is 11 inches (0.3m) in diameter with a horizontal opening. This problem must be solved at 5:30am, in the dark. There's a window nearby, with a base at 48 inches (1.2m) from the floor. From an engineering standpoint, it's easier to purge the nozzle out the window than to purge it into the bowl. I think any engineer would agree.  But for social reasons, it is unacceptable to purge the liquid outside of the home. Actually considering what is socially acceptable, the liquid may only be purged into the original bowl.

I'm a proponent of gender equality but I think mostly males face this problem and I don't know why it has not been solved.  Now I'm reminded of several other problems we have in society that have not been solved very well.

The measurements of the human body for the purpose of design is called anthropometrics. [This PDF](https://lobfile.com/file/LEdg.pdf) features some anthropometric data and the percentiles of the US population. I'll save it here for reference in future discussions.

## 08.14 There are only 2 reasons to jump

Today my close friend messaged me, says she's a little bit sad.  I'm honored to be a safe person to whom she reached out and I thought about her situation.  Just made a move into a new apartment, getting settled, nothing else really changed. And I think I've had the exact same experience before.  If you have ever played Frogger, then you might follow this analogy:

In the game of frogger, there is only one action you can do ► jump.  And there are only two reasons to jump.  The first reason is to take a step towards your goal, and the other reason is to avoid harm.  Just like frogger, life sends problems down our path such as logs and cars and things we don't usually consider problems, just minor events (as adults). If it's time for you to renew your license for example, you must take an action. We don't call it a problem, but it's something that forces you to act, or otherwise face problems.  These get much bigger all the way to having a newborn child and having to equip your home with new furniture for the baby.  

Well, why might you feel sad after you took a jump?  You knew it was required.  You didn't encounter any harm.  But now you are, if you introspect, in a whole new situation. So what is the impact on our psychology?  If all else is equal, you should feel the same as you felt before the jump, but there's an added burden. It's time to reassess the dangers or opportunities. Your mind will subtly be reviewing risks and new tasks required of you, basically a whole 360 scan of what's necessary ► and you have to do it while you keep your remaining life items steady.  It can be taxing.

I have moved apartments many times, and sometimes it is a jump for advancement and sometimes it is a jump by requirement.  The **actions are exactly the same but the psychology is far different.**  Just thinking about this gives me a little bit of consolation and readiness to "go easy on myself" if I just landed a required jump and I feel off.  It's time I note that reassesssing every minor change is actually a big task for a human and if we give credit to ourselves for this effort, we might be able to pivot sadness into a little bit of proudness and self reassurance.  Or, by some strong trickery of the mind, we could convince ourselves that it was a jump for advancement, and that is valid too.  It's your own life.

## 08.14 I almost burned down the house.

I dont always start a fire, but when i do, its because i found a new way to do it.  This time, the lawn sprinkler was too close to the electrical box.

Nobody was hurt, the house is ok, and i consider this a learning experience.  The painful part was losing HVAC for 24 hours and working a 14 hour sunday shift to repair the circuits in 110F texas heat, no clouds, no shade.

My home is from 1976 so the electric equipment is older than me. 47 years.  The outdoor panel was supposed to be waterproof and it was fully closed and locked. Further investigation is needed.

Here are some [photos of the damage](https://imgur.com/a/ux5YFTS)

## 08.12 Every morning, ideas

I'm waking up every morning overflowing with ideas, this month.  About philosophy, engineering, culture, language, business... I can't possibly write them down.  Here is a random one: laser ablation on acrylic round stock.  Fly fishermen and fly makers, jewelry makers, etc: they could have extremely detailed and transparent or glossy, accurate repeatable copies (or unique copies given our digital assets could be parameterized) of insects such as dragonflies and mayflies or whatever type of flies they like to make. The round stock can rotate and the laser scans, and they could actually build many copies in a matter of a minute if it works as fast as we can cut 1/4 inch acrylic sheets.  Extreme accuracy and detail, better than what we get with 3d printers currently.  And the true transparent color of acrylics is an asset for coloring as we wish.

## 08.11 Do you work for your tools?

Finally a nice way to describe the purpose of all my over-the-top organization.  The epitome of organization is that you don't work for your tools - your tools work for you.  Consider the things you own.  A screwdriver.  A broom.  A hack saw. Even a drinking glass.  Each of these, we can call a tool because it's a means to get something done.  To answer the question of who works for who, it is simple:  Do you spend more time handling the item or using the item?

The journey of the drinking glass.  Let's say I want a coffee and a half glass of orange juice for the morning.   The drinking glass does it's job while it's putting orange juice in my mouth.  The rest of the journey is: I set it in the sink.  I wash it at some point.  I dry it and set it on a drying rack.  It may air dry, or I need the space and I dry it manually.  I put it on the shelf.  I retrieve it from the shelf.  The tasks are stacking up quickly.  If the shelf is cluttered, I adjust other glasses to fit it in the shelf.  If there was a dishwasher involved, it went into the dishwasher and came back out.  If it's one of those terrible cups that has a bottom rim, I shake the water off and wipe it dry with a towel, then it goes to the shelf.  If the shelf has a door, I open the door.  If the door hinge isn't auto-closing, I close it.

When you add up all the handling tasks, it easily surpasses the time I spent with my lips to the cup.  So, we have an epic failure in my mind.  I paid money for a thing, and then I worked for the thing.  Lose-lose.  And if it's a thing I use daily, it's an eternal cycle of spending more time giving than receiving what I wanted.  The more you own, the more you work for your things.  In modern life you can easily consume all of your time working for things after you've already bought them.  

There are a couple of ways out.  The first way, is to buy more stuff to make it easier.  A better dishwasher that dries things.  A deeper sink that holds more stuff.  Fancier cabinet doors that swing shut.  A classy rinse aid in your dishwasher so you've got no spots.  Buy Buy Buy.  If you pay attention, you'll find that your purchases end up doing the same as the item that caused you labor.  The rinse aid didn't fit under the sink, so you journey to the garage to store it, and journey back to use it.  You journey to the store to buy more, or you journey online to order it, and when it comes in the mail you journey to find a tool to unbox it.  This is the way of the modern economy.  Buy more stuff.  Become momentarily happy.  Wish daily that you had better stuff, and spend enough time online to get advertisements for the solutions - the next stuff. 

The second way out:  Study yourself.  Notice where you spend your time.  Adjust your things, the layout, your habits, until your stuff starts working for you.  Purge stuff that serves you less than it costs you.  Simplify.  Go back to basics.  The more I do this, the more I find my solutions at dollar tree.  The complexity of life is reversing.  More time for leisure.  More time for family and doing the things I love.

And imagine, with a little bit of skill and a few tools, you can begin to adjust your own stuff to make it suit you.  The first thing I did when I moved into my kitchen was remove the doors from the cabinet I access most. It cost me 2 minutes with a screwdriver and it saved me hours by now.  Not exaggerating.  The removal of the door means airflow.  Airflow means I can put away the dishes wet, and they dry in place.  I don't even use the drying rack anymore.  Less steps for everything.

## severe weather 08.09
wow the heat in bryan is intense.  I had to make repairs to the AC and found a few leaks.  Earlier this week it was running nonstop and multiple rooms couldn't reach below 77F.  Now I've installed some additional insulation and repaired the insulation on the ducts in the attic.  Looks like the AC can keep up much better.
